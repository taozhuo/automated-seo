      "content_html": "<p>Hi! I am still developing at my bowling game. But now, I have recently experienced a new issue with the game: It loads like it should, and I it worked like usual until yesterday when I added a new GUI which is going to be a guidebook. By then, when I’ trying to run the game, I’ll be in the game for up to 1 min, then I am suddenly kicked out, and I get this message: “Disconnected. The server has shut down.”.<br>\nI have tried to revert to an older version, that did work, but as soon as I revert it back to the newest, it goes back to keep kicking me out. I think it is something with the new guidebook or something. It is maybe due to a new image I imported it doesn’t work.<br>\nAnyways, except that, I haven’t tried anything but publish the game as another game.  <img src=\"/images/emoji/twitter/enraged_face.png?v=14\" title=\":enraged_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":enraged_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Here is the image:<br>\n<img src=\"/secure-uploads/uploads/original/5X/0/7/0/d/070d8e84d71f1b8b173c49452197a4cf114b194b.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_2449\" data-base62-sha1=\"10oo1f1BK1x4iWQSoXVNxIcRWt5\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"></p>",
