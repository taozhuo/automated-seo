I have thought about running a [while task.wait(0.5) do] loop but i thought it would be laggy since it needs to run on the server for every single player character, which in highly populated servers might cause lag, i am not sure if it would create significant lag or not, ANY help is appreciated (References to other posts, clarifications, examples.)<br>\nThanks!</p>",
