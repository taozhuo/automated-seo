(This is because the control method mentions thumbsticks.)<br>\nSo, how can you use Freecam on a mobile phone? Or is it not possible?</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Hi! To enable freecam on mobile, you’ll first need to grab the Freecam Gui from the Player. If you take a closer look, you’ll see that the FreecamScript actually has an attribute called <strong>FreecamEnabled</strong> to it. All you need to do is add a <strong>TextButton</strong>- or script your custom behaviour when you want to toggle it.</p>\n<p>After that, you can add this function which will help you enable it:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"lua\"><code class=\"lang-lua\">local Player = game:GetService(\"Players\").LocalPlayer\nlocal PlayerGui = Player.PlayerGui\nlocal Freecam = PlayerGui:WaitForChild(\"Freecam\")\nlocal FreecamScript = Freecam:WaitForChild(\"FreecamScript\") -- The refrence to the Freecam Script.\n\nlocal function ToggleFreecam()\nFreecamScript:SetAttribute(\"FreecamEnabled\", not FreecamScript:GetAttribute(\"FreecamEnabled\"))\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: This has to be inside a LocalScript, so if you’re doing it from the Server use a RemoteEvent</em></p>\n<p>Aditionally, if your Freecam is toggled by a TextButton or an ImageButton, consider adding a task.wait() and setting your GUI’s Enabled property to true.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps.
