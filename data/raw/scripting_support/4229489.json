Ideally you should print the exact url that causes this error (after format with parameters and such), remove the proxy part (make it <code>roblox.com</code>) and copypaste it in an incognito tab in your browser to see if it still gives that error. If it doesn’t, it could be the proxy, or the request headers that cause it.</p>",
