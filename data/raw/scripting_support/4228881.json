Although it works when I manually make the victim myself, as in my own character, when I make it actually another user as intended they vanish, presumably to the correct position (although we have no proof it was the correct position just making it clear, so take it with a grain of salt), but then to appear back a frame later.</p>\n<p>This is the part of my code that does the positioning, specifically at the end:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"lua\"><code class=\"lang-lua\">local function CreateObby(character:Model)\n\tlocal humanoid:Humanoid = character:FindFirstChild(\"Humanoid\")\n\tlocal humanoidRootPart:BasePart = character:FindFirstChild(\"HumanoidRootPart\")\n\tlocal obbyLevel = humanoid:GetAttribute(\"BloxxerGrabObbyLevel\")\n\tlocal startPosition = Vector3.new(humanoidRootPart.Position.X,humanoidRootPart.Position.Y + 5000, humanoidRootPart.Position.Z)\n\tlocal nextPosition = CFrame.new(startPosition)\n\tlocal obbySelection = easyObbies:GetChildren()\n\tfor i = 0, 3 + obbyLevel, 1 do\n\t\tlocal selectedObby:Model = obbySelection[math.random(1,#obbySelection)]:Clone()\n\t\tselectedObby:PivotTo(nextPosition)\n\t\tselectedObby.Parent = workspace\n\t\tnextPosition = selectedObby.ObbyEnd.CFrame\n\tend\n\tlocal newObbyComplete = obbyComplete:Clone()\n\tobbyComplete.CFrame = nextPosition\n\tnewObbyComplete.Parent = workspace\n\thumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(startPosition + Vector3.new(0,5,0))\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have verified that the start position itself should be correct so its something else.</p>\n<p>Here is a video of this happening:<br>\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaSs0uotfuI?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"youtube-onebox\" seamless=\"seamless\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</p>",
