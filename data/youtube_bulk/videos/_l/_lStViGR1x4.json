Newar so if I were to play the game as you can see it runs the function and then here it prints hello on the on the on the script this time not the module script right so that's that's kind of the idea behind module scripts right it's it's literally just a table right where you can put in functions and you can put in variables now here's what's worth kind of explaining because for me I I I I was I was still struggling to get module scripts I was like oh like this is kind of confusing like why do I do module dot what's the point of like why do I have to do this right in Roblox when you create a table so I'm actually going to do this right I'm going to just going to delete this right I'm going to delete the module script in fact there we go it's gone I'm going to make a new table just call it new table and make it equal to this right in order to add stuff to tables what people do is they they say the table name then they do Dot and then they put in the name of something they either want to add or change right so if I say new table do um Newar right so right now the table is empty but I say new table. Newar is equal to 23 and then I print out the new table so right now empty right and but then by by doing this I'm going to add in um a new VAR item which is equal to one 23 so then if I print that then as you can see yeah it says Newar is equal to 1 two3 right um or what I could also do is I could just say something like you know new VAR equal to 1 2 3 so that's effectively the same thing so you can you could either write the table like this uh but then like I I do not recommend it because obviously the easier way is just to say um yeah now it's recommending it to me because it knows that there's a new VAR value in the table and now I could set it to be something different I could say it set it to be 3 to1 and now this will not this won't create a new Newar value it will just override the one we have already so we're still going to have one new Newar value but instead of 1 2 3 it's going to be equal to 321 what the module scripts are used for module scripts when you require them they just give you like the table right so what I could do here is I could literally just like have a table and I can add my own function functions to it right I can say okay new table do new function is equal to function and then I can have it print hello that is going to work well it's not going to run the function because we haven't actually ran it yet but yeah as you can see I I technically don't need module scripts I could do everything still from here so I have a table I give it a function and then here I could run the function I could say new table do new function just like so and then this is going to run the function and print hello that's that's pretty cool now why people use module script is basically just for organization right because again the module script is the same thing you know it make it makes a table and then it returns that table when a script requires a module script the reason you would use a much of script is because you you you sometimes want a table that has like a lot of functions you know or and like a lot of variables inside of it so what you could either do anytime a script needs all of those like functions you're going to have inside of this table sure like you could do this where you just you know make a new table for every script and you add all of the functions all over again you know for every single script that needs them or you could just have all of them in one spot in one module script and then whenever you need it instead of having to do all of this you just say just just you know local module table is equal to require script. module script there we go so now this module table is going to be equal to you know this table which obviously right now is empty but the beauty of the module script is that any single script as long as it has access to it is allowed to require and use all of the functions and variables that are inside of the module script right so that that's effectively all there is right so if you have any questions leave a comment if I got something wrong leave a comment if neither of those things happened still leave a comments um check out my the comments I I'm going to have a link to an amazing newsletter that you can sign up to where I'm going to give you helpful advice and every now and then I'm going to sell you my product my $7,000 course of course so you know make sure to sign up you know and look out for that and yeah I've deleted everything and we're back to basics thank you for watching", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:21.185207", "error": ""}
