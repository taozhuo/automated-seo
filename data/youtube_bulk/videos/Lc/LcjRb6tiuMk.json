"roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "hey what's up guys it's cover code here and in today's video I'm going to be teaching you the absolute Basics on how to use Roblox studio now let's not waste any time and get right to it now the first thing you actually need to do is download Roblox studio so I have a link in the description below taking you to the page I am currently on and this will pretty much show you a summary of Roblox Studio what you can actually do with the Roblox platform and a few quotes from from some famous developers here who have actually had a lot of success and pretty much this is the wiki link so if you have any questions about Roblox or the API this is where you'd go to and you have two buttons here start creating and start creating right here okay and if you click on this it will take you to the download page for Roblox studio and you just have to open that up you know same as installing any other program you've had before and then all you need to do is open it up so now we're just going to transition to Roblox Studio okay so the first time you actually open Roblox Studio it's going to ask you guys to log in but after you log in assuming you remember your credentials okay this is the page that you're going to see and what these are are basically templates for you to use if you've never made the game before so if you don't know how to make 3D models Like Houses cars and stuff like that these are just things to help you jump start your game making career but for the purposes of this tutorial guys I'm only going to be using the base plate template here so this is just basically plain Baron sort of uh nothingness essentially and there are also a few different uh buttons here but I'll let you guys explore those on your own I'm just going to click on this base plate button here and open up our very first game and this is what you're roughly going to see when you open up your game now the tabs might not be here your studio might be white if you're using the default theme however this is roughly what you should be seeing okay so you should have a um blank base plate here okay and you've got some tabs or none at all okay the first thing I'm going to show you guys is how to actually get the Dark theme because I know most of you are going to be asking that so just go to file Okay click on Studio settings and click on the studio tab right there scroll down until you find this General sub tab click on the theme and click on dark and that is how you get the Dark theme now Basics okay you can actually move around on Roblox Studio using the wasd keys just like any other game so wasd like that is gonna move you around Roblox studio if you press Q you're going to sort of go forward and if you press e you're going to go backwards okay and if you hold the right Mouse button you can actually look around so that's the basic of like basics of navigating Roblox studio now let me actually show you how to make a few tabs so if you're following tutorials and you don't have the same exact tabs that they have open I'm going to show you guys how to make those visible okay so the primary way you do this is by clicking The View button up here and here you have a wide array of tabs that you can actually make visible so all you would do is just click on this for example and it made this tab visible if you want to move this around just click hold on the title area right here and this will move around the the tab if you want to like sort of anchor this somewhere like this you're just going to drag this on any area of your screen actually and release and it will put that there okay but I just prefer this down here because you know just personal preference another way to actually view tabs is by going on the model tab here and clicking on these now the only one that you actually need is the insert objects tab right here okay this will actually allow you to insert things into your game especially if you're building or scripting so now let's actually use this and you know create our first part now if you don't know what the part is I have a tutorial on how you can actually build on Roblox so go check that out however this is just basically a sort of piece that you use to build on Roblox and if you click on this and click on this move tool here so go to the model tab click on the Move tool you have one two three four five different tools that you can use for basic building purposes you have the select tool here which you just select things with and click your left Mouse button hold it down and just move things around you have the move tool which allows you to move things in different directions okay like this you also have the scale tool which allows you to resize Parts models Etc okay like this and you also have the rotate tool which allows you to rotate things in different directions as well okay like this specify the you know by how much you move things and rotate things by modifying these values here again I have a tutorial on building so if you want to actually get you know more familiar with the building aspect of Robux Studio then I would suggest watching that now another useful thing is if you just click on the select tool go to the Home tab and select anything you guys want in your game okay you're going to get these three options highlighted we have the copy cut and duplicate okay these are just different ways you can actually clone things in your game so if I right click these will also show up here so you know pretty basic cut paste uh duplicate and you actually just duplicate a part move that around like that so pretty basic stuff again as I said if you want to actually learn about building I have video on that link will be in the description below however let's move on to the more interesting stuff so if you click any object I ideally a part okay and click on this material tool here you're actually going to be prompted okay so click this Arrow here you're actually going to be prompted with this selection sort of list here so you can actually change the material of an object okay so if I want it to be marble as you guys can see I just made that marble okay and you can play around with this all you want but I'm just showing you the basics of Roblox studio now you also have the option to color things so if you click on this um you'll actually be shown this limited color wheel and you can actually just choose a color of your choice and I'm just going to choose red and that's how you color things on Roblox a more sophisticated method of doing this is actually clicking on a part or a model or whatever you guys want and make sure you can actually see properties okay and this is pretty much a list of things describing that object which you just clicked on um and again you would use this if you were coloring stuff uh you know changing the material right here changing the transparency of that you know this is just a more sophisticated way to you know modify the things in your game now one of the most handy things around is the anchor tool so right now if you just go to the properties you can see that it is not anchored now if I move this up okay and I run the game and what I mean by run is imagine someone joins your game that's what happens when you run the game okay so if I click play like that going to load me into my own game okay and as you guys can see this fell down that is because it's not anchored so if I select this and I move it up it's going to fall right back down um okay so a bit of a technical difficulty there my PC just froze but um if you just move that up it's going to fall right back down if you're anchored it's toggled off so if you stop that okay and get back to the studio view click on the object again and click anchored okay and this time when you join back again it will not um you know it will not fall down again so essentially you just anchoring things in place that's why it's called anchor now uh the other tool is lock so see how it can actually select this tool right here if I lock it by clicking on the part and then clicking on the lock okay like that and just go to try and select that again I won't be able to select this or click on it okay but I will be able to to select something which is not locked now the way you'd actually go about unlocking it is just clicking on this lock tool over here click on the part that you want to unlock and there you go now it's unlocked and you can actually select this and move it round once more now one of the most fun things in Roblox studio is the terrain editor okay so if you just go to the Home tab click on this editor button here you'll actually see this tab okay so let me just put this here just for ease of views and these pretty much like this tool allows you to make terrain so let me show you this to you guys so you have three tabs create region and edit click on the generate button to generate some terrain I'm just going to scroll down and click generate I don't care what type of terrain it makes and as you guys can see it's actually making the terrain for me okay so if you ever want to make a map with terrain this is the way you do it now obviously don't do it so carelessly like I did because um it actually allows you to change the the properties of the terrain so if you don't want Hills then you toggle that off but I just you know I just clicked yes and I just made the terrain now the other things like the edit tab here what that does is it also shows you a multitude of tools okay which you can actually use to modify and sculpt your terrain let me just show you a few of these and then you can just go on studio and mess with this yourselves uh so just click add and this will actually add terrain on your well whatever you want really um subtract subtract the terrain pretty self-explanatory so if you want to make a tunnel that's the way you do it uh grow just you know grows things out of the ground so if I want this to be slightly bigger that's the way you do it erode the absolute opposite of that so just digs essentially smooth you know it's smoothing things out and the rest you can just play around with Okay so let's just close the terrain tool that's just you know the region tool does something similar you just select the region and you move it around similar to the move tools but for terrain okay so that's what that does pretty much now one of the fun things uh the more fun things on Roblox studio is actually the toolbox so just go to view uh toolbox and this is pretty much a selection like of how do I say this it's a selection of things that people made for you to use so if you want a house and you don't know how to make a house just search up house and it'll load up a selection of houses that people made for you to use so you just drag those in like that and Bam you have a house in your game and obviously you can do this for pretty much anything so if you want a horse or something like a horse and you drag the horse into your game just like that and that's how you use the toolbox now I've already covered a part of this but if you want to test out your game so if you're learning how to script and you want to test your script or if you just want to test out your game if you're building you just click this play button here okay now you could either play here which essentially spawns you where your camera is you just play which will spawn you where the default spawn location for you guys is and you can just print I mean just press run so what run does is well this it spawns you win camera view essentially so you don't actually spawn with your character the game actually you know runs but your character is not there you just move around with your camera okay so and the way you'd actually go around uh to stopping this is just click stop okay so that's how you stop your little play test and now the final most important thing is you actually need to publish the game so you might have made changes in your game inside of Roblox Studio that's fine however they will not actually be registered by a registered I mean if someone's playing your game they won't actually see the changes live you have to update the game um using something in Roblox studio and the way you do that is just clicking this file button here and just press publish to Roblox or publish to Roblox as I'm just going to say publish to Roblox and this is going to pretty much ask you to make a new game and if you've already published the game then that's just going to publish the game and not show you this window and this is just a few like properties which you can modify about your game um you know pretty basic information you know what devices you want your game to be available on what genre the game is and you know who the Creator is and you're just gonna write a brief description about your game here if you want and you just click create and your game would be published and that guys is how you use Roblox studio just the very Basics so thank you guys for watching like subscribe leave comments in the comment section down
