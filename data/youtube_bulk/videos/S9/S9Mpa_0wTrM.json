beginner tutorial so we'll only be learning some of the fundamentals I will also be throwing in a few events subjects but only in an introductory manner so you guys don't get too lost to be honest I haven't been active on roblox the past 4 years so I am a bit rusty I had to do lots of refreshing to get back up to speed so if you guys who leave a like I would greatly appreciate that to start off or what I need to launch a roblox game and to do that obviously you're getting to go to roblox calm one-shot robust calm you just see towards the top a button that says create so if we click on that it'll navigate us to slash develop which basically looks like this you won't have 0 games but if this is your first time to do anything maybe a couple of games but just for this tutorial I'll be creating a new game so click on that button and I'll choose baseplate just to keep things clean then click create game they should see a new game towards the top I'll click on edit and then they should launch for a block studio if you don't have roblox studio installed it'll probably start downloading in the bottom left here you would just click on that installer and then it will pretty much run this right here and once you're inside of your game it should look something like this if you're not already familiar with roblox to do you just use this to actually create your game I like to have my roblox 2d look a specific way so I'm going to be changing out the windows I'll just get rid of this here I want to keep output I'm going to get rid of the terrain editor I'm gonna move properties more towards the left and this is how I like it Explorer output properties and if you can't find these windows you can always just go to view and then you'll find them up here so I'll put output you know he's just hide it like that same for properties and same for the Explorer more on these windows a little bit later before we continue you'll need to know a few things first you need to know datatypes all you really need to know about is a boolean number and a string these are really basic the most common you'll be learning these in another tutorial but for now just numbers string and boolean nice create a script and set of server script service and to do that we'll need to dive again to Explorer right click on server script service insert object and script will just get rid of that here the string data type is a text value you know code is a string when you see characters wrapped and set of rotations so something like subscribe to wrd and side these quotes as a string the number data type was literally just numbers so if you put those numbers and set up a quotation and I become the string which you can tell from the syntax colouring numbers are blue and strings are purple but just know that numbers do not have quotes around it because again if it has quotes around it is a string remember that the boolean data type is just a true or false value true means exactly as it doesn't plain English true means yes and false means no again writing them in quotations will actually turn into a string so you can't ever just write true instead of invitations and expect it to act as a boolean this will be parsed as a string in certain conditions as technically can be used as a boolean so those are the three data types really know about they're pretty simple now let's use those data types inside of actual coding I'll be writing something in the console or in lua terms print so type in print parentheses quotations hello world notice that we put a string inside of these parentheses so now what it's going to do is output this string or text into this console here the output navigating through the script menu tab we would look for this play button with the roblox character over click on this drop-down menu button and then click on run and this will just run all the scripts inside of the game and notice inside of the output it says hello world so technically you just wrote your first script congratulations this is actually a big step albeit a simple task this is where lots of great developers start and learning a new language the longtime tradition of printing hello world I know that this is extremely boring and seemingly huse 'less but we will do a lot more very soon like moving a brick patience please now stop printing the number data type so again I'll just type in print parentheses and I'll just put in 99 and you know you feel like you make it longer if you want because we clicked on this Run button here you now see a play button so you can click on that and then you'll see that it prints this exact number into the output of course we can get the exact same output by putting it in quotations but by definition that this is now a string not a number data type in most situations this will be treated the same way as numbers what the number data type you can do or arithmetic so print 5 plus 5 and then you get 10 because 5 plus 5 is 10 and oddly enough you can do 5 plus the string of and then it'll still print out 10 which is really weird because in other languages this doesn't work out but whatever there's something to keep in mind and now let's try printing out the boolean data type so printed true let's also do another line of print false and run you'll see it prints out true and prints out false and of course you can't get the exact same output by just wrapping inside of quotations but again it's not actually going to be a boolean value because now by definition is a string because it's inside of quotations you know just to show you true and false again and output so that was a really simple quick start as you saw we inserted a script into a server script service and we typed in code and then the game executed once we clicked on run and I'm not sure if you noticed but roblox actually has a syntax highlighter so when you make a string you know it's a string because it's purple when you have a boolean you know it's a boolean because it's like this dark blue color and when you have a number you know it's a number because it has this light blue color you can't actually change the syntax highlighting colors but by default these are the colors you would see so now let's move on to comments comments aren't actually code they're quite literally just notes for the code or to read it is completely ignored by the Lua executor and when you have hundreds of lines of code it's gonna be difficult to kind of read through everything again especially if you haven't looked at your code after weeks so leaving comments can be great refresher being a new learner of roebucks Lua you'll definitely want to frequently write comments sort of write a comments you would start off with a double dash and then you would write your note right after it which might be this is a YouTube tutorial and then that will be ignored by the Lua executor but like I said comments are ignored by the Lua executor so if I were to type in print then the string of HelloWorld it's not going to print into the output because again comments are ignored so let's run and show you there's nothing in the output but it's not like there's a Sables the entire script because if I were to type in print of blah blah it'll still print it to the output you see blah blah because this isn't commented out but if I were to comment it out no it doesn't run so it's really useful to just leave notes above your code so as you should have noticed the double dash only works for one line so this is called a single line comment it doesn't actually comment this out because as you saw it still executes but if you wanted to comment out multiple lines you would use something called a multi-line comment and to write that you would type in double dash two opening brackets two closing brackets and then two double dashes and then between that you would type in your comment so this is a comment a put code in between that it should show you that it is an actual comment this shouldn't print and then under our comment but this will print so we're gonna expect this to not print but we'll expect this one a print as you see that works we're almost done here one more thing with the boring stuff so let's move on to variables a variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our code can manipulate it can hold different types of variables so a variable can hold a boolean a variable can hold a string and a variable can hold a number so if you were to pick the variable name of my var my variable and then say equals one two three my var is now this exact same thing as 1 2 3 so now if I were to print my var notice it's case sensitive so you would have to type it exactly as you named it capital v capital v here and run you'll see that it outputted one two three your names can be almost anything so like I can let me just do this that's complete nonsense it's not reserved anywhere and then just paste that inside of print it'll print out one two three there are a few names that you can't use for example print because print is already used by Lua so you got to pick something else another thing to note is that you can't start your variable name with a number so this will not work it's going to error and you know it's a problem because it has this red underlining here but you can't end your variable name with a number and I'm to show you that variables can work with other data type so I'll create a string and say please like this video hint hint will print that out and then you should see please like this video in the output you can even do arithmetic inside of your variable so one plus one you should expect it to print out two because one plus one is two as you can see two we can even use the boolean data type we learned so my bar true and then it should print out true because my bar is equal to true so that's all the boring stuff out of the way so now let's try actually manipulating the game I'm going to right click in the game here and insert part and now you just got this brick in your 3d space so now if we click on the brick and then look inside of your properties window which if you copied me I move my properties window to the left you'll see a bunch of properties listed down here to the left is the property name and to the right is the property value if I wanted to change brick color inside of the game I can just click on the brick and then choose a different color here so if I choose red its gonna be red and then you see its name is really red if I choose black then it's color is black instead of changing the color manually let's try doing this with the script navigating back to our script that we created I'm going to say game dot workspace dot part so this works the same way as the file tree would like how you would navigate through your folders inside of windows so game is basically your game Explorer and then from game we would go into workspace and then from game we would go into part and by clicking part you see that it is highlighting this it's selecting the part inside of workspace and workspaces inside of game now let's select the brick color property so dot brick color this is case sensitive so when you're going to select part you're going to want to select the exact name notice has a capital P so I put in a capital P brick color has a capital B and C so I put in a capital B and C and just like you would with a variable you can set the value by using the equal sign and then we'll put in brick color dots new parentheses then we'll put in the string data type being whatever new color you want so if I'm writing Lee changed this to white so now you know it's white and then say if the string value will be black and then we run this script you'll see that I changed the black now let me just show you a quick little something if we put in weight and then parentheses you should pass in a number here and it will say 3 the numbers out of the parentheses of weight is just the amount of seconds I should pass before it moves on to the next line so we're going to wait three seconds before it changes the color to black and then we'll add another weight down here let's say three seconds again we'll navigate down the Falla tree again to game dot workspace dot part dot brick color equals brick color dot new parentheses and then your string whatever new color you want so eggplant we just type in that brick color name and then it should change it eggplant after three seconds so again some when we click on run the script is going to wait three seconds and then it will change the color to black it'll wait three seconds again and then it will change the color to eggplant which is purple basically so I'm navigating back into this game View tab you can go over to the test tab and then click on the Run button wait three seconds it's black wait three seconds again it's now eggplant and looking at the property you see it says eggplant so you pretty much is it a lot in this grip you use the number data type to make the script wait three seconds before moving on to the next line and then use the string that are typed to pass a new value for brick color so now I'm gonna create a problem to should show you how Lua works a little bit I'll copy this brick I'll repay sit back in the workspace and now looking at this code here you're gonna see who's gonna try navigating into game dot workspace dot part so the game Explorer workspace dot part and the change sub brick color to black let's see what happens you see that I only changed one if you wanted to change both obviously that's a problem so to solve this we would just select one of the parts that has a duplicated name right click it click on rename and we'll just say you Britt - it could be any name of course now if we navigate to game dot workspace dot - brick - again case-sensitive and then set brick color equal to brick color dots new plum now if we run you now see that both of these brick colors were changed and of course if you wanted to change it to black then go ahead I'll change they'll both change to black let's make this file tree navigation slightly more complicated so I'll be grabbing brick - and then drag it inside a part we just made brick - a child of part so to navigate down to it we're gonna have to do game dot workspace doctor part brick - and now you can do brick color equals the color dots new black as you can see that worked but if you were to just do game that works paste of brick to die brick color this doesn't work because brick 2 is not a valid member of workspace as you don't see brick to you inside of here it's inside of part and that just means there's no direct child of workspace that is named brick - you have to go workspace dot part dot brick - like you saw inside of the script here so now I'll just delete brick to make things slightly more simple and let's try changing another property let's say we wanted to change the position obviously buddy needs to navigate to the part so gain that workspace top part dot position equals vector three dot new and the vector three value is basically the position inside of a 3d graph so let's set the x value to five the Y value to ten and the Z value to 15 you would have to delimit these by using a comma and by running the script you're gonna see that the part is moved they went all the way here and clicking on the part so selecting the part and then looking at the position property right clicking on this drop down button here you see the X is 5 y is 10 and the Z is 15 of course you can manually change that here to figure out what direction is up should have made that anchored well now you know that to change the position you have to do vector 3 and then enter the XYZ position values which are numbers now let's try solving that problem how that brick kind of just fell so I'm gonna go over to this model tab select move and I'll just drag this up a bit I'll just get rid of this code to get rid of any interference and if you go back to test and run the brick should fall because we do not set the anchor value but if you click on the anchor check box this basically sets anchored to the value of true it should stay in the air we just anchored its position it's gonna stay exactly where it is but once you disable anchored it false now that changed us how your script you would obviously navigate to you part again so game that workspace tough part dots anchored equals true it's the same with that manually so now it's gonna set it to true we will expect this brick to not fall in tree hit run and great it doesn't fall now let's set this manually to true so if we hit run obviously it doesn't fall but to make it fall using the script will say anchored equals false and then you see it does fall because it is no longer anchored thanks to you sending the incurred property to false you'd pretty much change all the other properties the same way using the three data types I showed you in the beginning of this video string number and boolean 's except for the few special things like we saw with color we had to use color three new let's try changing the material if you click on this drop-down button and select grass you see it gives it this different texture to change that usually Lua script you would obviously navigate to your part game that works we stopped heart select the material property and then we'd set that equal to a string values as you can see it's a string to check out the options you can choose again you would just look at this drop-down menu here and let's say I want to use foil I'll put foil inside of this string and then run and now and now you see just change to the foil material if we get rid of the quotations it's no longer a string and it's pretty much expecting a variable or a global but that's more advanced I'll teach you what Global's are in another tutorial oil isn't defined anywhere so this will error and now you see it's not changed the foil so now you know that you have to use quotations if you're gonna try to set a string value I just showed you that a while ago but let's try setting a value using a variable so let's choose a variable name I'll save Matt bar material variable set it equal to boil let's copy that variable name and then put it right here and that we should set the parts material to foil you could have done that with positions too so I'll just name the variable to my bar equals vector 3.2 new let's say 5 5 5 say game that works because top part dot to position equals my var so now we no longer have to do equals vector 3 new because you can just use the variable which already has this value here so we'll hit run and then you should see that the position will change to 5 5 5 as you saw position 5 by 5 so you'd pretty much change all the other properties the same way if you wanted to change cast shadow you see it's a check box so you would say gander workspace top part that cast shadow equals false you should already know how to change color the change material obviously you see it's a string so you would set the value equal to a string being whatever options you can choose reflectance would be a number value so you would say again that workspace top part the reflectance equals 0.5 we don't see it because the material is weird to see the reflectance you're going to want to set it back to plastic and now you should see that the reflectance is changing so back to 0 no reflection back to 1 then you see that the cloud is lefting onto the brick same thing for transparency he would say again that works based on part that transparency equals a number of value 1 being completely invisible and zero being completely opaque you can see it point 5 being half invisible so set this back to fully opaque and let's try changing the transparency with the script game dot workspace part transparency equals a number value and again it's from 0 to 1 so 0.5 to make it half invisible hit run and now you see it's f invisible at the change the name you would pass in a string because as you can see that's what it is it's a string orientation you see it's got these three values with the two commas you know it's a vector 3 position so and that works based apart the orientation equals vector 3 that new and then your 3 vector values position vector 3 but rotation velocity vector 3 velocity vector 3 and your boolean's here number blah blah blah it's pretty obvious so I pretty much just taught you more than enough to get going with basic Lua scripting you know what I consider to be the three basic data types string number boolean you know how to navigate the game's file tree using the script and then changing a bricks properties you know how to use the console and you know and you know how to use comments to leave notes under your code you learned a lot and that concludes this beginners robot to a crash course there are so much more to learn but that's all I'm going to be teaching in this beginners tutorial if you want to be getting deeper into roblox sua check out the roblox through a documentation or look out for videos on
