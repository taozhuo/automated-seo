"roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "making a robo game has been a dream of mine since I was young and I've tried many times to do so every time I failed due to my lack of knowledge but not this time I challenged myself to learn scripting in one week and if this video is out it means I did it let's begin before we begin let's have a quick overview of the plan for this challenge everyday I will learn something new to do with scripting I must spend at least an hour and a half learning how to script every day with this new knowledge I will try and code something anything by the end of the challenge I would create some sort of game even if it's small if I failed to make this game I fail the challenge let's begin with zero knowledge of scripting I open the script editor and try to code something anything the hell am I even doing it seems I misjudged how hard this was going to be I went on you YouTube and found this YouTuber called the dev King who had an entire series on how to code without hesitation I started watching how do I do the dev King help in just the first day I had completed this beginner series and I was very tired despite my fatigue I was engulfed in the teaching methods and along with my trusty notes I had really began to pick up the basic principles of scripting with my new skills I hopped into studio and created this I'm the best I'm literally the best it was was a small victory but it felt amazing day two baby let's as day two began a problem arose although I had completed the beginner series I know very cool it wasn't enough to be able to call myself a scriptor the end goal of this challenge is to make a full game but I wasn't at that level yet I wanted more I needed more I needed to become a king at scripting or so I hoped I dived into the first video of the advance series and it was pretty simple but as I got to the second third fourth fifth the hell does this even mean he's he's yapping like crazy if I don't understand this how am I meant to even make a full game my warrior mindset had depleted as I felt the disappointment of failing I was on the verge of quitting but then I remembered what my good friend jansu told me listen Sim jet you got to remember every master was on to begin that could be you too yeah Broski is not the main character after Jam's words of wisdom I made day's code and prepared for day three to make up for the episodes I didn't understand I used a well-known tool called the Roblox documentation if you don't know what the Roblox documentation is it's a collection of resources that help you learn how to create Roblox experiences it contains tutorials samples and API references for Rox studio and is a great way to learn program programming and designing on Roblox I continued watching and use a Roblox documentation to fill any gaps in my knowledge look they even have an AI that will answer all my scripting problems I was back on track and I was really starting to feel like a real coder so I asked my friend cyber for a small task Oh my days oh my it's jump scoot that cyber I forgot to tell you something now's not the best time to tell you but the reason I the reason I called you here was to ask for an idea or something to code no not now bro well why not we're doing this bro let's just get these books let's just get these books Jam's got two Jam literally has two oh my he's right there I'm going up with him no way Jem oh my cyber run cyber run Oh my days what what Jem oh shoot cyber cyber why did I decide to tell you indoors where's the books where's the book yes another book I see a book right there oh my God there's gem no no how did you die how did you die you died first exactly there to be like a portal system they have to get around the map portal system so cyber came up with a good idea of making a portal so let's get started first I inserted two parts into the workspace and added a script into the part that I want the teleporter to be in I then defined that two parts using variables and created a function that occurs whenever the part was touched and then made sure the part that touched it was a humanoid root part and if it was it changed the SEF frame of the human root part to the SEF frame of the location so if we touch this part we should get teleported yep nice it works let show cyber a creation bro that is trash where is the special effect and the sucking in animations and stuff like come on man I expect it better from you man you suck huh despite what cyber said my warrior mindset was back with the help of the robo documentation and the the dev King's methods of teaching I was on the verge of becoming Unstoppable I had covered tween remote events SE frames and I had finally reach a GUI series gu are the core components of making a game I mean it's literally always on your screen so I knew learning GUI was going to be a big step on my journey guys I'm not even going to lie gu are so easy I mean look at this shock concept I made it even works on an iPhone 7 a few hours later i' completed the dev King scripting tutorials and I understood the basic syntax needed for coding although I had learned how to script I had no idea where to start on making a game um what the sigma I'm joking I'm going to do it all myself my plan is to make an Obby but a bit more advanced I'm not going to show the process I've making this game here because I made a whole video on it here's some of the scripts that I made whilst making this game and here's the final game I'd been grinding my butt off for 5 days straight so I took a break from The Challenge to refresh my mind for the final days in the meantime I updated my mini game posted a whole video on the update drank loads of tea and consumed a bunch of carrots after touching some grass my energy was restored for the final stretch of the journey I swear this happens every video brother SE affecting me nah this is just more motivation for me let's do this now that I had all the core knowledge needed to script it was time to make the ultimate game ah the fresh air of an empty base plate I decided it was time to make my first ever simulator I click simulator I started by making a leader status script that save when you leave and load when you join and I remembered to enable access to API services to allow it to work as you can see if we change the value of the clicks on the server leave and rejoin our value saved nice I then insert Ed a temporary button and made the clicking system of the game by using remote events if you don't know what a remote event is remote events is how you connect the server and C together the client is what the individual player sees such as the own cursor and server is what everyone sees such as the map the reason for using remote event is so that you can connect things client sided and and Implement something sded it's kind of confusing but hey at least I understand sorry about that my inner nerd came out I also made sure to add a debounce to my system to prevent you pesc or auto click as you can see the cling system is working yeah since day five mini game took 24 hours I only had an hour left of the day to work so my time for the day had ended on day seven I continued the game by adding two new lead stats rebirths and gems you can rebirth by using clicks to increase your click power and you can get gems by rebirthing also don't judge the crappy UI we'll change it in a bit now about the gems you're probably wondering what's the point of gems if you can't do anything with them now you can spend your gems on more rebuffs to get more gems to get more rebuffs to get more gems to I asked my Discord if they wanted the menu to open from a GUI or an actual in-game shop and the in-game shop building won but I wanted the GUI option so we're going to do both and after 5 minutes of simple coding we now have a menu opener thingy I then coded the system where what no day seven was completed and I hadn't completed my game H who cares I've learned how to script now let's just finish this I then coded the system where you can buy more rebu for gems and it turned out pretty well here's what we've got so far so far so good I then asked being IM creator for some UI Vector icons because yes and it gave me these I transformed them into these masterpieces and put them into my game along with some frames for the menus as you can see we've got this thingy right here which shows the counter for how many clicks you have I then made a sick popup appear whenever you actually click by the way guys I am using the help of Dev blocks for this game but I'm not entirely just yoinking as code cut me some slack man I just Le a couple of days ago next I made this portal with a padlock disappears whenever you have enough clicks to afford it although the portals are working the actual worlds will be coming the next video on this this game so stay tuned for that I then added a bunch more upgrades that you can buy such as click multipliers walk speed you get the gist and then J Scot challenge me to make a map of the game in 3 hours so let's have a Time La shall we and then Place some benches around the map Place some pads in case we use these spots in the future and also made a how to play GUI to guide new players on how to play obviously finally I made a module script that abbreviates numbers to a shorter form for example instead of this long number we can have this nice and short and beautiful and with that our final game is complete it definitely didn't take days throughout this journey I've learned a lot including scripting GUI data Store and More you guys must remember not everything you saw in this video contributed to what I learned it obviously took hours of practice and grinding this is just the beginning of my journey there's still loads to be learned so I'm going to keep grinding anyways I want to thank the dev King for his amazing tutorials Jam scoot for his wise words of wisdom and cyber for his motivation anyways like And subscribe join the Discord and I'll see you guys later see you all right Sim you w my respect", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:13.551356", "error": ""}
