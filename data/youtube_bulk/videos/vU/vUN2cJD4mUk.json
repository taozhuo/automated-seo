"query": "roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "should you learn how to make Roblox games is a question I've been wanting to answer in a video for a little while now however there was one small issue I don't actually know anything about Roblox so there was only one logical solution I challenged myself to learn the ins and outs of Roblox studio in only one week in this video I'll go over what I did on every day of the challenge and at the end I'll give my thoughts on the engine and I'll explain whether or not I think you should learn it depending on your skill level and goals and if you already know that you want to make Roblox games then hopefully you can learn from the tips I give as I explain my learning process but first I'd like to go over my history with Roblox up until now cuz you see I actually did play Roblox from around 20 9 to 2011 and while today Roblox has grown into this huge platform that's worth like a gazillion dollars back then things were a lot more simple now I was like 6 years old so my memory might be a little fuzzy but I think I remember playing a lot of games like obstacle courses natural disaster survival work at a pizza place which are still around today but not quite as popular and also back then there wasn't any smooth terrain everything was made out of well blocks it really just felt like playing with Legos but on the computer and it was really fun but I would eventually stop playing in 2011 when I discovered Minecraft and moved on to that without ever looking back and that was it for the next 12 years of my life I didn't play Roblox or really ever thought about it I knew it still existed I would hear about it from like memes and stuff but that was about it so when I made my intro to Game Dev video talking about Roblox never even crossed my mind so I was surprised when I got a comment asking why I didn't talk about Roblox and then I got another and another and another and another and I got a lot of comments asking about Roblox and I thought Roblox that's not really a game engine right and thus I embarked on a quest to learn more about Roblox over the course of 2023 I would discover just how much had changed in my 12 years of absence for one some of these games are actually really good and a few of them don't even look like they were made in Roblox it's actually insane it's no longer just Lego godod I can see why people call it a game engine the only problem is those good games are kind of rare and they're usually hidden under a mountain of lowquality games and in recent years Roblox seems to be having a lot of issues but I'm not here to talk about that instead I want to focus on the game development tool itself Roblox studio and find out if it's a good engine so why am I doing this well two reasons for one I've only ever made 2D single player games so the idea of making 3D multiplayer games was really exciting and two I actually have a game idea that I think would be a nice fit for Roblox so I thought I could try to make it after the challenge that is because I'm going to follow my own advice I will not learn the engine just to make a game instead I'll make a game to learn the engine so I tossed my game idea aside for the time being all right now that this is finally out of the way we can get on with the challenge starting with and life you have ROBLOX so day one I opened Roblox studio and went in the default starting place I completely ignored the built-in tutorial and instead had my friend Ekko show me the basics I learned to move around and select stuff then move scale and rotate objects then he showed me the marketplace where you can choose from an endless amount of user generated assets and put them directly in your projects for Better or For Worse you'll see what I mean as a test I grabbed the Santa model and I tried to see how big I could make it turns out you can make things really big then I tried using the smooth terrain feature which is all right I didn't end up using it a whole lot so I don't have much to say about it but it looks nice then I learned about roblox's team create feature which allows for multiple people to edit the same game at the same time which is honestly really impressive like I think that's really cool I don't think any other engine let you do something like that as far as I'm aware then after that we started messing around with random Marketplace models and things quickly got out of hand you can really search up the weirdest crap you could probably search up like Thanos sand and something would probably come up some gen Alpha thing SCU toilet scoid toilet R Ohio it's real I hate it I hate it so much sans's undertale he's te- posing look at him oh look at him s under oh oh jeez that's a little too big no not him I want to click his head think his head really small but his that is pretty funny if you search a boss fight you just get the funniest crap Obama boss fight Obama boss fight yes I want to play Obama boss fight there actually is an official Obama boss fight game you want to go official official by who the government yes what no I'm joking OB I want to play the Obama boss fight you want to play Obama boss fight yeah all right bro I'm sending it oh yeah and then we got distracted and fought Obama for a while what is this I don't know what is this bro what is this thing can't K it anymore oh OB s oh that's not Obama that's just president stuff Obama boss cuz yes Obama Minecraft what is this I can't think it anymore why is the baby in the sky did you do that no what what what go back the oh my God that's a that's a that's a the baby Among Us you did that there's a big wall over there what the f is this go check it out oh no oh my god oh know it this is this is Roblox development oh Jee oh uh oh I'm sorry oh my god oh it's laggy oh what what did he there there's a thing that said there's a thing that said box so sus you should place it and then I click on it I think it's a torrent what I think it's a the should I should I allow the scripts no should I click okay please no 20,000 no now this might it seem like I was just messing around and I was but for a good reason you see I have this one special trick that I use to help me learn anything I call it making it funny by simply making something that makes you laugh learning becomes a lot more fun you're also a lot more likely to remember something if you have a funny memory attached to it for example if you're learning how to apply textures why use a boring test texture when you can instead put a dumb meme instead or when debugging why print hello world or test when you could instead print something funny no one's going to stop you you're going to see a lot more examples of what I mean throughout the video I don't know if that sounds silly but it's the small things like that that makes gamedev so much fun for me in any case I didn't just mess around on my first day I also learned Lua the coding language Roblox uses to make scripts since I already know a couple of languages this was really easy and all I needed to learn was how Lua was written compared to the other ones that I knew and if you're struggling to learn a coding language especially your first one let me share with you the trick I use every time I learn a new language I simply make a text file and then I put examples of every new thing I learn so like an example of creating a variable or an IFL statement or a loop or the print function anything really by doing that I don't have to remember absolutely everything by heart I can simply copy and paste the examples whenever I need them instead of manually typing out the whole thing every single time and after a while your brain will start to automatically remember stuff and you won't need to look it up anymore this isn't Lazy by the way Pro pramming is all about saving time and copy pasting millions of players are doing the stupidest on Roblox God I hate the French whose idea was it to recreate this Neo Gothic nightmare day two this day was by far the steepest part of the learning curve I started off by putting aside the whole mess we did yesterday and instead created a new empty project going into it I already knew exactly what I wanted to code first a block that moves listen when I say you should start small when learning Game Dev I mean it so I found a tutorial and after a bit of confusion I got it to work and then I used a few for Loops to make it move in a square pattern now that's cool and all but it doesn't move the player when you stand on it which I expected was going to happen because it's technically not really moving it's just a static object teleporting slightly on every frame so I thought oh I know I'll try to manually code that in just check if the player is touching the platform and if so change the position like I knew that probably wasn't the best way to do it but I at least wanted to try skip ahead an hour later and nothing works I have no idea what I'm doing wow it's almost as as if trying to forcefully learn something that you don't even know if you should learn isn't a good idea so instead of racking my brain to figure out why something I don't understand doesn't work I moved on to something else I tried to learn user inputs as a test I thought I'd make it so that a brick would move when you press a certain key sounds easy enough so I put a script inside the part and follow the tutorial but it doesn't work turns out this user input service thing only works inside of a local script all right then so I create a local script and put the code in there and it still doesn't work oh turns out local scripts only work inside local objects and local objects are only for the player and not the physical 3D space oh okay then how am I suppose to code interactions between the player and the game world is what I was thinking at the time the problem is that I was still trying to code with a single player mentality but Roblox is a multiplayer game it doesn't work like that so I came to realize that I had to throw out all of my preconceptions and start to learn how to think with multiplayer for starters I went and learned how to properly read player inputs but then I discovered the instance function which lets you create new objects from a script so for fun I tried to use it from a keypress and to my surprise it actually works even though it's a local script so shouldn't it not be able to create server objects well whatever point is it works then for some reason I had the idea of making a ball spawner that would shoot out spheres everywhere after a bit of tinkering I got it to work but for some reason when it spawns it waits in the air a little bit before moving in the tutorial I watched it did the same thing so I don't think it's something I did wrong but it still really annoyed me so to fix that I simply made them invisible by default then made it so it would reappear a few frames after spawning it does not fix the original problem at all but hey it works and finally to finish off the day I learned how to add UI elements and things went smoothly for once I figured out all of the basics from a mix of messing around on my own and reading the documentation oh yeah and then I made a button that kills the player when you click on it and then I made it spawn an explosion too for good measures going into day three I knew exactly what I was going to do I was going to have my revenge on the moving platform and I would make it work the right way this time so I simply follow the tutorial and at long last I got it to work okay that's not supposed to happen uh oh I just forgot one line oops all right so now moving platforms work but while I was trying to fix the issue I found out about tweening which allows you to smoothly move apart from point A to point B which sounds simple enough but was a whole another issue to figure out getting one of them to work was easy enough but in order to keep the square pattern I had to chain several tween in a row and I could just not for the life of me figure out how for a while the first one would work fine then the second one would play twice and then it would stop moving and when I did eventually get them to play one after the other it started moving in a diamond pattern instead of a square pattern but I quickly realized that was because I misunderstood how the end points worked anyway once I did that there was something else I wanted to try so earlier I did say that I wouldn't try to make the game idea I had but surely trying to code just one of the game mechanics wouldn't hurt right I'm not going to reveal what the game is but what I can say is that I need to be able to change the color of the player's body parts I was easily able to make it work on a dummy character but for some reason I could just not get it to work on the actual player character I did find a tutorial that led me change a body part's color when colliding with another object but even with that knowledge I still couldn't manually change the color whenever I wanted now I did eventually figure out the problem at the end of day seven so in the meantime I tried to learn something else I wanted to make a projectile that the player could shoot with a mouse click but right away I faced the same problem I did on day two when I tried to learn player IM inputs except that this time around I had a lead to go off of a little something called remote events so I carefully read through the documentation attentively followed the tutorial and before long I did it I now finally knew how to link together client side and server side code with that knowledge in hand I felt like nothing could hold me back anymore now all I had left to do is make it so that the projectile moves in the same direction the camera is pointing at and since I was feeling so confident I wanted to try coding the math by myself using the power of sin and cost to transform camera angle values into speed values for all three axes fast forward 3 hours and I got kind of close I could get it to work in two Dimensions perfectly fine but as soon as I put all three the angles would become slightly off now by then it was like 3:00 a.m. so I decided to give up and look for the solution and as it turns out I could have just done this yep that's it a single line of code that's all I needed to do in a sentry on day four Ekko wanted to show me how to do basic 3D modeling on Roblox like by using blocks of negative space and fusing them to other shapes you can make holes and by fusing simple shapes together you can make some simple models so then we made a basic little campfire model and added a few particle effects and then we started adding a bunch of random models and got sidetracked again but I'll spare you the details this time anyway after that I wanted to try making a character model so I grabbed a few random shapes and made a totally random stick figure thing then I gave it a rigging skeleton and used it to make a very simple cartwheel animation and then I didn't touch the animation feature ever again but hey that's good to know I guess afterwards I wanted to learn how to display VAR balls on the HUD which led me to learn how to use the leaderboard so then I needed a way to test it so I looked around the project looked at my ball spawner and thought yeah sure they'll do and made it so that the money value goes up every time you touch a ball but then I got hit by a flash of inspiration in a sudden stroke of Genius I got a game idea so I immediately got to work and quickly built a simple prototype and over the rest of the day I would try to polish the game as much as possible I started by trying to add a texture to the Spheres and I decided to go with the good old Roblox man face I originally wanted the texture to wrap around the whole thing but for some reason Roblox treats spheres like cubes and gives it six faces that you can apply a texture to so I settled on using six separate decals to cover the whole thing then I wanted to make the Spheres Fade Out and despawn after a while but for some reason I couldn't change their opacity anymore and it took me way too long to realize that the Spheres did in fact become transparent but not the decals so I had to also change the decals opacity all six of them then I added two new types of balls a green one that gives you 10 points and a red one that kills you and with that I finally had something that started to look like a game now I also wanted to have a high score value that would get saved when you quit the game and come back and in order to do that you need to use what Roblox calls data stores but it looked kind of complicated and it was getting late so I decided to stop here for the day stop posting about follow I'm tired of seeing it my friends on Tik Tok send me on Discord it's so for day five I picked up right where I left off and started learning data stores and as it turns out it wasn't actually that complicated I got it working in like half an hour so then came the real test posting it to Roblox and trying it out for real so I made an announcement on my Discord server and got a few people to join and sure enough when they left and came back their high scores were saved well that was easy I sure do hope data stores don't end up causing a ton of bugs later down the line anyway now that I finally had a game Prototype I wanted to polish it as much as I could before my 7even days were up I started by giving the arena a little makeover now the camera can pass through the wall and they're only visible from the inside then I put it in the air and added a floor all right let's test it do not forget to Anchor floating objects oh right yeah yeah okay yeah there you go oh and also I lowered the floor a bit so now the Spheres can fall off the map I thought it made the game more interesting all right now this whole game idea started because I wanted to show a variable on the UI so let's actually do that and there you have it another thing I can put off my checklist let's see what else do I have in here here oh particle effects let's do that okay so real talk the Roblox particle system is really good like okay seriously look at this when you make a particle object you can modify things like color size transparency texture speed direction frequency how long it lives and more but then for some attributes you can open a graph to customize the value for any point during its life span and the changes apply in real time as you modify the graph and while I was writing this script I realized that you could even put a range of Randomness for any given point on the graph like yo that's so cool it gives you a lot of control while still being very easy to use okay uh I got a little carried away there but point is I added some particle effects when you touch a sphere awesome and finally I also put a glowing orb in the spot where the Spheres Spawn from and yeah that's about it for day five hey guys today we're going to be doing a Roblox game play oh okay day six let's speed things up the first thing I did was adding a little popup above your head when you grab a sphere and to achieve that I decided to use something called billboard GUI which basically allows you to have a UI element somewhere in 3D space about an hour later I got it working you know no big deal I was starting to get used to Roblox Studio following that I decided to split the money value into two things a score value that tracks how many points you have in the current game and a money value that tracks how many points you have in total because of that I had to rework most of the leaderboard and UI code which wasn't too bad but that was just the beginning making this change also meant that I now had two variables per player to save in the data store and that caused a lot of problems but I'll skip all the boring details what matters is that I did get it to work after a few hours and by that I mean that it was now midnight I felt bad for not adding that much new stuff for the day so I thought I'd try learning one last thing sound effects and uh yep it sure works one thing to note though is that you can only upload 10 sound effects a month which kind of sucks you do have unlimited access to the marketplace but put me down I can't take this please put me down what yeah it's a mixed bag anyhow before stopping for the day I finally gave the game some much needed sound effects have a listen all right the final day I will was starting to feel the strain of working on something 6 days in a row without taking a day off but hey if I want to be a game developer I'd better get used to it am I right anyway I wanted to spend the day adding as many features and as much polish as possible but after doing a quick multiplayer test I realized that data stores were still completely broken Bren and would cause various interesting bugs like having someone else's car show up on my UI somehow and then other bugs were just silly mistakes like here in the code that runs when you die your high score gets saved to the data store and if your score is higher than your high score your high score gets updated Can you spot the problem here well let's say you got a new high score and then died your current high score gets saved to the data store and then since your score is higher than your high score your high score gets updated so at that point if you were to quit the game and come back your high score would be lost you might have a mental image of a computer bug as being a small little math error that causes big problems but more often than not it's really just dumb things like this anyway after a long time of fixing similar bugs I finally got everything working correctly for real this time all I had to do was remove the part that wasn't working instead of fixing it okay now that everything worked I could finally start adding content and oh my God it's already 1: p.m. now with the limited time I had left I wanted to focus on diversifying the game play cuz as it is now every life is basically the same so my idea was to give the floor platform some random events using our good old friend tweening I can give the platform custom movements such as closing opening opening a lot tilting tilting but closed spinning moving side to side and my personal favorite bouncing I still had many ideas left like making a y element warn you about the upcoming event but unfortunately my time was up there's still quite a few things I wish I had learned but overall I think I'm happy with what I managed to make in only 7 Days oh and if you want to try the game out yourself I'll put a link to it in the description well before I knew it the Roblox learning week was over so what did I think of Roblox Studio well I liked it I thought it was really fun to use there were a few bumps along the road of course but overall Studio was really easy to learn now sure I already knew how to code and I have some Game Dev experience but Roblox Studio was the first time I ever successfully used an engine that's 3D multiplayer and only uses code cuz as a matter of fact most of my Game Dev experience actually comes from codeless engines now do I think Studio should be your first engine uh no I'd still recommend scratch but here's the thing in general most engines will have a trade-off between how easy it is to learn and how much power and freedom it gives you and I felt like Roblox gave you a pretty nice balance you're limited by the fact that you can only make games for Roblox but in exchange you're given a tool to easily make multiplayer games and by the way making a multiplayer game is really hard it's not as simple as clicking the make multiplayer button in your engine and on top of that hosting Game servers costs a lot of money yet the fact that Roblox will just give any anyone free server space at no costs that's really cool you shouldn't take that for granted okay so back to this graph real quick if your goal is to make a big 3D game but all you know is like scratch then I think Learning Studio could be a great way to ease the transition into bigger engines engines like oh I don't know Gau for example which incident the way gdau works with its node system is kind of similar to how Studio works with the whole parents child system I'm just saying lastly I'd like to quickly go over why I think Studio was so easy to learn mainly I'd say it's thanks to the official documentation This is How I Learned almost everything more than any tutorial and especially more than the AI assistant this is where I learned it all as long as you can like you know read and pay attention pay attention you can learn everything you'll ever need to know about Studio it's as easy as going on Google and typing Roblox than whatever you're trying to learn and usually it's the first link don't know how to use a search engine no problem just rightclick on any object and click help and heck in the code editor it'll constantly give you a short description of whatever you're typing and if you click the learn more button it'll send you straight to the documentation so you have no excuses Roblox is easy to learn and yeah I think Roblox studio is pretty fun however that's not quite the end of the story I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't also talk about Roblox itself so I quickly mentioned around the start of the video that Roblox has a lot of issues but there's one in particular that really bothers me here's the thing with Roblox for those who don't know Roblox has a premium currency called Roo that you can buy with real money and spend on in-game items and then as a developer you can add in-game purchases to your project and get a cut of the roox and if you're really successful you can become a Roblox partner and trade your roblo for real money and some people have gone actual millions of dollars doing that so chances are if you want to make a Roblox game it's because you just want to make some easy Roo but but here's my problem with that how do you think these developers made so much money by making really good highquality games and using honest business practices yeah right come on who am I kidding most likely it's by using the same kind of 30 tactics mobile games use to maximize profits like daily login bonuses limited time sale pay to win mechanics battle passes microtransactions loot boxes and of course gambling dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it ah yes selling gambling to Children a classic oh but it's not it's not real money it's fake in-game currency see it's not gambling yes ingame currency that you can buy with roblo which you can buy using real money I really think it's a shame that this is what Roblox is teaching to Young aspiring game developers to be greedy instead of wanting to make a fun experience and from what I've heard the Roblox algorithm seems to push games that make a lot of money which in turn makes the game more popular and thus makes more money regardless of if the game is actually good or not so if you want your game to be popular you don't have much of a choice or do you you know it doesn't have to be this way I don't think so instead of complaining that Roblox isn't what it used to be why don't we do something about it after all Roblox games aren't made by big companies they are made by people like you and me and what I hope that I've managed to show with this video is that making Roblox games is easy if I could learn to do that in a week imagine what you could do in like a month or two you know you could even have a couple of friends tag along thanks to the team create feature and when you play Roblox and you finally find a good game tell people about it share it to your friends support the Creator if you can you can also watch share and make videos about underrated Roblox games and if you know anyone that wastes their Precious roox on brain rot games try to convince them to maybe stop if we all do our part then maybe just maybe we can make Roblox a slightly better place and you know what if you you want to put a little donation option in your game that's fine if you can make a few roblo like that good for you that's awesome just don't do it just for the robo do it cuz it's fun all right but hey at the end of the day only one thing is for sure in life there's Roblox oh", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:16.881712", "error": ""}
