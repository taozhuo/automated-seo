"query": "roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "for the next 24 hours I'll be learning on how to script in Roblox Studio I'm going to be using multiple working methods on how to learn scripting super fast hopefully become a scripting God by the end of the video myself I barely have any knowledge in scripting so this is going to be super fun and useful by the end of the video I need to make a Obby with only scripts that means I can't place any parts and everything has to be done through scripts just already imagine mowing aart with only code yeah this is going to be fun will I become a scripting God or completely fail stay tuned to find out so I started off by just doing what pretty much everyone that do use YouTube you can learn pretty much anything on YouTube nowadays so I searched up the fastest method to learn scripting I found a video by smarty that claimed that it will teach me beginner level scripting and I watched it all the way through after watching smarty's video I have learned the basics of scripting I'm going to quickly resume what I learned so print statements can be used to find the error in your code and can be used with string values Bing values and number values Nan scripting basically equals nothing with instances you can insert any object inside of Roblox Studio remember I need to make my own Obby with only scripts so I'm going to be using instances a lot all right if statements can be used if you want to check for something for example if the part is anchored then print the part is anchored and if it's not you can use else for example to destroy the part events no not those type of events Roblox Studio events there are a lot of them and you can find them in the Roblox Studio object browser but the most useful one is touched you can use it to detect when someone touches a part you can use a while loop to Loop through a part of a code while something is set to true for example this code is going to Loop until test is set to true then using break it will stop looping through the code I'm almost ready to start creating the Obby but there is one more secret method that nobody really knows about it's a Roblox game called Lola learning so what do we have here we have tutorials submitted by actual Roblox scriptors and players this game offers multiple lessons starting from the basics to the intermediate level I already know the basics so I moved on to the second chapter print two statements first check the type of any string value then check the type of a bulling value yeah I'm so proud that I was able to do the task in the first try let's just skip the boring part but for the next hour I spent my time completing all of these tasks now it was time for the fun part the game offers fun quests that you need to solve with code let's first of all make a function the player move forward yeah to be honest I don't know what I'm doing I don't think there's even a function like this in Roblox so I try to take a different approach and it actually works equipped with the best knowledge I can finally start creating my Obby so we are finally ready to create our Obby and I can use only scripts that means I cannot insert Parts I cannot color them and everything has to be done through scripts so I started my journey by creating a new script called part spawner I wrote a code to spawn in a part inside of work space but it didn't go as planned um where is our part also remember I have to make a wall Lobby like this I guess we can add print statements so I actually don't know what I'm doing then I was doing something completely unnecessary and I didn't realize the part was already there okay I finally realized they needs anchor the part and set its position to something oh it's a vector 3 value I got it so I fixed up the eror and used Vector 3. new and set the part size to 5 comma 1 comma 10 yo it actually works let's go after what felt like ages I finally made a decent spawn location and now I can move on to make the stages I tried making a new script for each one of the parts and adjust the X Y and Z axis I mean it worked but it wasn't effective so I merged all of the scripts together into one big script so I think this is going to be it for the first stage you know what let's actually get rid of the base plate script the parent destroy then I inserted the new script for the second stage and I was so confused on how to make the platform spawn in the right place the size okay this should work hopefully yeah let's go it works why is the first jump so big and now it's so small but I would want to add checkpoints later I'm right I did add checkpoints later but they took me ages to make this already hurts my brain I cannot even see the Obby and and it's so hard I tried adjusting the size and position for the first obstacle on the second stage but yeah something was wrong now the wall game is not working great oh my bad I can't insert a new instance called stage has to be a part I need to somehow find the center of this part and I need to measure it in studs so I can yeah it's way too complicated yeah as you can tell everything was going downhill until I actually fixed the part and I was so hyped I don't know why next I needed to add the kill bricks so I adjusted the size and colored them bright red yo it's actually neon now I think we should space out the next ones by around let's say six studs so I copied the script a bunch of times and made each part six studs further away let's go now I need to make the kill Parts actually kill you so player touched. connect I don't know what I'm doing to be honest I was still a pretty big Noob at scripting but I have already learned a lot since I was able to create the function after a couple of attempts yo it works let's go finally so now we need to create the third stage let's insert a new script for that so then I copied the spawn location part and adjusted the position to place it at the end of the second stage for the third stage I wanted to try to rotate the part minus 45° and it turned out pretty nice so I copied them a bunch of times and adjusted the position a bit to finally finish the stage on to the next stage so let's name this script stage 4 I took the spawn location from the first stage and messed around with the position to place it at the start of the fourth stage I could try to make something interesting for the fourth stage like those fading platforms that slowly fade until you fall right through so let's copy this so let's for the size let's do something like I'd say 40 * 20 then for the position let's do 60 and this should work let's see yeah it didn't work so I had to change up the position a bit I tried writing a fading script but to be honest I had no clue what I was doing so lost right now while I was looking through the Roblox Creator Hub I found the perfect script for my game it had just what I needed the fade function so I added the function to my C and tested it out let's quickly do our Obby I need shift lock no now it should start slowly fading yeah this is straight up impossible so I changed the rate variable to something a little bit higher so let's see if we can walk over in time yeah it's doable now to get the spawn location for the fifth stage I just copied the first script and move the platform 13 studs in the air I mean it looks all right for the fifth stage I want to to make this obstacle where you have to jump from one ball to another ball so I tried writing a script for that that spawns in a spear but it wasn't really working so I looked it up on the Roblox D forum and I found this script that I'm going to use yeah this is absolutely perfect for stage five let's copy a lot of these balls then I wanted to test out the new stage but it didn't go as planned oh my God why can't I do my own Obby yeah I wish I could add admin commands but I cannot place any parts let's just pretend that never happened yo finally we're up here and these jumps are impossible okay for the sixth stage I want to do something harder because each stage gets progressively more difficult so I tried spawning a one St jump okay uh nope it's the wrong direction I fixed the problem by changing its direction and I copy and pasted it a lot of times making each part two studs higher in there what did I even make right here why is that one so far away yeah I might have accidentally set the parts position to 200 instead of 20 now it looks a lot better the stage wasn't fully complete yet so I copied these parts a bunch of times and made the spawn location for the seventh stage let's go finally something is working okay I don't know what happened to my footage but making the seventh stage took ages it was so hard to spawn in the kill bricks and right areas then I tried spawning in the next platform and this happened okay I'm genuinely confused how did I even make this I accidentally set the size to 41 instead of the position so now it should be fixed yeah there we go for the eighth stage I'm going to make it very simple it's going to be just one part but there's a catch it's going to be rotating and it's going to be very hard to balance on I try to copy the function from the forth stage and changing the transparen to orientation but yeah as you can see it's not rotating so I have to take a different approach on how to resolve this so I try to use C frame to rotate the part but yeah let me just show you what happened let's go and finally at the top please work no then I switched back to using Vector 3. new and also added a task. weight so the game doesn't crash and guess what we have to do again we have to complete this wall Obby again first of all I don't want it to rotate this way second of all it's rotating super slow I was getting frustrated because I couldn't make the part spin correctly until I decided to make the code know what is the part's position and then make it rotate now it should work which means for the 100th time I have to complete this godamn Obby yo it's actually working it's rotating how it should now I just needed the end platform so I copied the first spa location and placed the 42 studs in the air now we have eight stages that are completely made with only code I don't even know how I made all of this but now I want to add checkpoints I don't even know if that's possible but we'll have to see so to do that I have to figure out a system to spawn all of the checkpoints inside of a folder and make them to be on the top of the big platform I started off by inserting a checkpoints folder which will contain all of the checkpoints and I try to insert a port but for some reason it wasn't in the checkpoints folder so I tried to adjust the position and name it stage one yeah there is an error but luckily I just miss spelled Vector 3 I continued on to insert new checkpoints for each one of the stage and colored them red they look pretty cool but now I have to make them work so I started off by just writing a simple later stat script that inserts a folder and an in value but also I need a script that updates Your Leader stats and makes you respawn on the checkpoint so I tried to Lop through all of the checkpoints and add plus one wue to the Player's leader stats player added is not a wallid member of players yeah I got an error but I figured it out and it was just a typo I misspelled player added yeah the folder is not getting created oh I literally just forgot to do this to Stage I just copied the whole part of the script and I forgot to rename it to Stage finally the leader stats folder got created but there was a bigger problem that was coming in my way yeah yeah it looks like we have a slight problem plus if we reset um yeah we're back at here boom we don't need that script anymore and I'm going to write a completely new one this one will move the character to the checkpoint and hopefully won't go crazy on adding volumes shoot there are already a couple of Errors I need to fix so after a little bit of thinking I figured out what I need to do in my checkpoints Handler script the checkpoints are named stage one stage two and Etc you know but I need to name them like 1 2 3 and Etc it should work like that oh my God my spelling is so awful today I pray that it works now why I'm already at the first stage oh come on I tried to resolve this in many ways well the first one was to name the first spawn location zero and pray that it works yeah that's not going to happen then I tried to add a part on top of the spawn location and name it zero the part is invisible but it acts like the first checkpoint yeah now you're spawning properly and please I hope the checkpoint system will work we got the volue and now if we reset yo it actually works I'm so relieved now this took ages to make let's go I'm now glad that the checkpoint system works but you know what would be cool if there was a button that a player needs to click to spawn in the Obby yeah this idea was great but nearly impossible I tried inserting the button through screen Dr I I mean that was working but making it actually spawn the Obby was quite impossible I tried everything whooping through all of the parts and making them invisible disabling enabling scripts adding weight variables to stop the scripts but nothing worked even though this idea was amazing I just couldn't do it usually I would stay up till 3:00 a.m. to fix the issue but this time there was a time limit and the time was running out okay enough with the dramatic stuff but it was sad that I couldn't make it work but that's when I got a even better idea I will make animals fall right from the sky and players will have to dodge them to complete the hobby so I added a new script in server script service and I don't know why I named it anchor falling script it should have been anvils instead of anchors anyways I used the while loop and math. random to spawn Parts randomly in the air but it wasn't as easy as it seems CPT service attempt to compare number to nil my bad I forgot to set the part count to zero the code was working but it wasn't spawning the anvils in the right place so I changed up the code a little bit and yeah this happened yo what as you can see the code needed a lot of adjustments so I changed the math out random values and also made the script wait for 4 seconds and then destroy all of the anvils otherwise it would just crash the game yeah the parts are spawning way too fast so I made the script wait for 0.3 seconds and with that my Obby is finally done if you want to play it I will leave a link in the description So after 24 hours did I really become a scripting god well kind of I learned a lot on this journey but as a wise man once said there's always room for improvement", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:14.863838", "error": ""}
