I learned to shift on roblox alright now we were taking a trip down memory lane guys I'm not gonna lie this is gonna be a bit a bit sentimental for me I guess you could say but I'm gonna teach you guys how I learned the script I'm gonna show you everything I did what I didn't do I'm even going to show you guys like my first ever game I'm gonna explain how long it took all that stuff my entire shifting journey I'll explain it all in this video so yeah it's gonna be interesting so people asked this question will be every single day they're like dude how did you learn the script how long would it take you all that stuff okay and um I was sending all that but I'm also gonna show you guys my first ever game okay and that's gonna be embarrassing it literally the game is so bad I wouldn't even like it's private right but I'll Shami and I'll play on the video but it's so bad okay I'm also playing guys also explain the best way I think to learn just kind of today and how you can learn script in my opinion so yeah be sure you like yourself be out guys and subscribe if you want more robust development videos like this one and Alyssa started all right so first things first at the beginning okay so my programming or scripting career started in about late 2017 when I first tried to learn Python okay which is a different programming language if you guys didn't know robots uses Lua so yeah anyways so I learned a bit of it but then ended up stopping because I had no use for it okay I basically learned the language but then I was like okay what do I do now right I was like I didn't know what to do with it I didn't really know how to make anything else outside of tutorials so I just kind of gue I just kind of quit right I didn't really know what to do with it so I'm I stopped programming but I didn't have fun with it I enjoyed it I like programming it's fun for me right so in the summer of 2018 I decided okay I want to learn how to script on roblox so I did right so the main way I learn how to ship though is probably what most of you have done but also there's a few of the ways that helped me as well so yeah so the main way I learned a script alright here it is boys the golden question I learned to script few different ways but I would say the main way I learned to script was watching YouTube videos okay it's specifically Peas Potter right he made it very easy to understand he form out of this super nicely and I just I loved it right like I would literally stay up all night watching his videos and skipping along with him alright I'm not joking boys like I was obsessed with learning Austrian okay it was like my biggest hobby at the time to be honest with you because there's a lot of fun for me right I enjoyed it um I can literally like yeah I literally remember the Sun rising while I was trying to watch his videos like I'm not joking like it it was just like it was a good time in my life okay that's all I would say um but okay obviously I still didn't learn everything from his video Cilla right like he didn't teach me every single thing I still had to learn a few other things um you know I sort of fill in some gaps here and there and also he actually stopped uploading which didn't really help right he didn't upload any more didn't teach me anything new so that was kind of a shame but yeah actually that's kind of one of the reasons I started my youtube channel or this channel because um you know the rules dude there really wasn't any good like you know roblox development channels still like uploading his like alpha blocks wasn't up putting much of the time pee spots up and up letting you know they all gonna stop so yeah anyways that's why I made the channel but that's not the point awesome that later okay anyways so what are the other ways I learned script so um another way I learned right after I finished all those videos I was - I was still trying to learn some things I'll show starting to like understand data storage stuff like that so I would go on the robots wiki okay if you don't know what that is I'll show you I'll gradually right now but basically the robots wiki is like a it's a wiki right before robots developers and so there's a bunch of cool like articles on here about like like certain stuff like for example let me go in the learn roblox section as you can see there's a camera manipulation there's a catalog api's there's actually that's kind of interesting I'm a Tigers fan later anyway so there's a article to make on a game had a you know add sound and music all this certain stuff right it wow that's kind of interesting Lua and how it she's sharp compare okay anyways a lot of cool stuff there right and a lot of things you can learn but also like the API reference that was a flood thing I feel a lot of things for me right so like certain things like you know I don't know like if I need to see the properties or or like the functions of an object right that's how I checked in here sort of like that right it's how I'd reinforce certain things and just kind of remember the key words to like that so definitely use this if you aren't already but that's not the way I learned I guess and then another way mocchi among certain that yet but yeah other we probably free models like just kind of reverse engineering those like opening the scripts to what they said but anyways let me go and show you guys now my first ever game okay this is gonna be embarrassing okay so this important thing is to I actually was applying things that I learned okay I wasn't just like watching the videos and then you know doing something else after or like not even coating at all I wouldn't I was watching the videos I was also I had robux to do open and I was writing down everything I saw right cuz I wanted to reinforce that code in my brain I wanted to learn I remember it right I wanted to know what it does not want to do it I wanted to be able to test it myself okay so definitely if you're watching youtube tutorials that is a must write down what you're doing okay code with the guy if you have two monitors that is very helpful I thankfully did so I could you know I had my video on here and then I had my iRobot studio monitor right so that was useful so um definitely do that if you can are anyway so but once I learned the basics right and I thought I could program a few things I started working on an actual game okay now the first game I ever made and I would say this really is a first thing I ever made it was called tunneling simulator okay and it never released and never saw the light of day unfortunately I know I say you know finish her games but this is in the past you know I wasn't the same guy was back then but um it was it's so bad alright now obviously guys this game okay I'm pretty sure I made it like a fall 2018 you'll see in a second here let me pull it up oh gosh this is gonna be embarrassing all right here we go so as you can see right here got the game yes I was right fall 2018 it was August I think I'm that month is yeah come on birthdays in July when we're saying all right so yeah August and um that's that's it so here we go boys we're gonna play it right now it was public for it I can slight bit of time I think actually I think it was public recently but I forgot the private it so yeah as you can see this was the thumbnail I don't know why that was a thumbnail but yeah you also have one game fast that's cool all right let's do one plate I'm gonna with your time let's see you and says oh god this is gonna be so embarrassing okay all right boy just all I'm gonna say is don't judge too hard member this is this was two years ago okay two years ago so I'm not as bad as skipping anymore okay so um yeah also um someone actually something I should help me with a build an app by the way one of my friends he actually put the map with me I'm so fond of the mid stage so that's cool but uh here it is guys tunneling stimulator as you can see we have this oh the quality of this thing is disgusting what is that I don't even know all right but that's that and we have a walk speed game pass thing we get you by that's pretty cool that worked good kind of a feeling I guess we had I don't think is even worse to be honest with you I I really could not figure this out back I remember struggling with this so bad can we buy it desert pickaxe I right now if the ice pickaxe no it my pickaxe is just gone now all right well um no okay well maybe Victor reset and fix that I don't know we had a little image sort of thing here I never finished it I remember I never finished that quest that doesn't even work we have our backpack okay so let me actually show you guys how this game works okay so as you can see there's a shop right here I don't know why this shop here if the shops over there that makes literally no sense but as you can see it's kind of like mining simulator but a tunnel okay so what I'm gonna do right here is add my pickaxe alright and oh the collection box doesn't show anymore I was a bug okay anyways so I have oh my gosh I messed it up when I reset okay wait let me rejoined I promise the game is insane all right let's not it's not okay but I want to get how the mechanical works okay it's probably pretty simply pull you understand it but like I said it's kind of like mining simulator but sideways it's just like a tunnel so as you can see spawn in okay and you have a pickaxe all right and you just mine so as you can see I'm selecting these things are here and it has the value of it so it's one it gets one point or whatever or one coin and then it has a health more under it so if I hold and click it'll actually mine this and as you can see it's actually it's actually working it does work and then yeah never mind it doesn't work okay I saw worked at one point guys and worked at one point but anyways that's how it works used it it would work better I used to work with her I swear I'm I guess I must add up somehow and then actually would get the thing and then I would sell it and then here it would sell and then everything would be dandy obvious as you can see this is like a little bit harder than mine but this was the game alright it wasn't actually that bad yeah it wasn't real what am I saying this thing was awful the map was really bad too um but yeah that is telling simulator that is my first ever game and man that that is that is that alright let's let's get out of there before it's too late alright anyway so that's person free game alright so now um what is the best way to learn tripping nowadays in my opinion okay nowadays of course it's watching you to this video okay it is the most easiest a straightforward way to learn watch youtube videos I believe it's super simple and super easy to learn right and actually of course we're gonna talk my own series peace pod is awesome I shout out to him you know if you want this video to do I love you but if you want to learn today you're asking what YouTube videos to watch I actually have a beginners series a beginner scripting series that literally anyone could watch and learn even if they were scripted before at all I'm not joking I've literally had countless people tell me they learn the script and I've never even met them right that's super cool but that's why my news videos right so I can teach people how to script so if you wanna learn how to script there's a link to the in that's in the description on the beginner series it's bringing this series literally if you even if you've never even opened a script before on roblox it'll teach you how to script okay it hid you from the basics basics okay so yeah be sure to watch that at the interest in learning script but as you can see here this is just two screenshots I found people were like hey deaf King I watched her stories for a while now and I've made a mini game so I'm gonna have similar to epic mini games all thanks for your love all thanks to your vids from Sweden that's super cool look at look at it look at this guy this is really cool too he says I won't with deaf King I want to thank you so much for teaching manuscript I've got together now a hundred fifty campus it's all from you that is awesome I mean man like literally the fact that I've never even met this guy he joins my game tells me this and you know I turn I'm on a script that's so cool to me that makes me happy it really does um but yeah oh if you weren't around script in my opinion watch my series it alert each other script there's so many people that are with you also be sure to join discord servers where you can connect other skippers that's important too but yeah anyways also like also and honestly guys in my entire skipping journey I was like a
