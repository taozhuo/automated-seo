"query": "roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "there's one really big mistake that beginners make when starting to script on Roblox the mistake is so big that it makes beginners lose months of progress and destroys all of their motivation and energy to script Bob right here is about to make that mistake and his entire scripting journey is going to fall behind by months so this is Bob and this is his first night I guess of learning scripting and this is script you may know him because this is actually me this is me when I was 12 years old in sixth grade by the way I'm currently 21 I've been scripting for 9 years now and this story that I'm about to tell you is based off of my past so I wanted to learn to script Super Saiyan Transformations like from Dragon Ball Z and I wanted to learn this very very badly because the thought of being able to script anything I wanted someday the exact way that I envisioned it made me very very excited for the future now Bob right here wants to be able to script so that he can impress his friends nothing wrong with that I mean you can't blame him at this time both me and Bob are 12 years old it's currently 600 p.m. and we're both learning to script but our approaches are very very different so let's see what Bob is up to okay looks like Bob is actually watching a scripting tutorial from future me well that's pretty good he's learning something and looks like he's headed in the right direction I mean if you're watching my scripting tutorials then you must be learning something so as long as he presses like And subscribe then you know he's all all good now let's look at me on the other hand what am I doing here so this right here is 12-year-old me and it looks like 12-year-old script is watching Dragon Ball Z okay it's very interesting we have Bob over here who's watching a scripting tutorial and then we have me who seems to be procrastinating just watching anime I mean wow this guy must be headed in the completely wrong direction he's he's not watching any scripting tutorials at all okay so now they both go to sleep so let's simulate that so they both go to sleep and then some time passes and some more time passes and suddenly it's daytime all right so now both of them have gotten some rest and let's look at what Bob is doing okay so looks like Bob is actually watching my video on how I scripted a juggernaut so from the looks of it it looks like he's watching this because it might be motiv him because maybe he's thinking about huh what if I could script this then my friends would think I'm amazing maybe he's just thinking about that or maybe he's just watching to figure out how I coded it or whatever the case may be but I would be surprised if he's watching this video on his second day of scripting because this is a very very complicated kind of thing to script for a beginner for a complete beginner I mean this thing uses things like raycasting and impulse and you know I wouldn't expect a beginner to be able to understand something some of these Concepts someone that's never scripted before never done any sort of coding before and plus Bob is only 12 so I mean I'd be surprised but anyway this is what he's doing nothing wrong with it I mean maybe he's a child prodigy and maybe he's understanding some things okay so let's see what script is doing now so let's move over here and it looks like oh looks like now I've started watching a scripting tutorial from future me so this is 12-year-old me watching a tutorial from 21-year-old me let's just make that make sense in any case he has started learning to code so he's just watching this video and now some more time is going to pass here's a sun so some more time is about to pass so now boom boom bo bo bo bo boom it's now about 12:00 all right so Bob is still watching some tutorials he still got his bubble gum and let's see what script is doing so oh script is no longer in his bed looks like he has the laptop open and it looks like he's still watching tutorial but it seems that he might have paused it and he's no longer in bed I wonder what he's up to hm well if we look over here we can see oh he's over here and oh okay he looks like he's in this computer not not this computer isn't anything super powerful it looks like it's pretty it's a pretty standard computer and it looks like he is looking at ROBLOX Studio this looks like a really old version of Roblox Studio okay so it looks like script is looking at ROBLOX studio and maybe he's just thinking about how it works maybe he's trying to learn some things on his own so he's not even started he hasn't even started coding yet he's just looking at ROBLOX studio and looks like he's just trying to make sense of what all of this is so for example he's looking at the toolbox like what is this this what happens if I click this and then he's looking up here he's like huh okay there's so many different buttons I can click here I've never used anything like this before I see some explored thing here I see some properties here and I see all of this stuff here and I see the game over here now script hasn't used this before so he's just trying to get a hold of everything he's just trying to point out like what does he see what does he wonder he's trying to understand Roblox Studio before he understands scripting okay so now some time is going to pass so here we are okay we're going to see the sky get darker and okay the moon is out okay where is everyone all right so let's look over here oh looks like script is no longer using the computer looks like he has he's probably gone to sleep let's go find out oh would you look at that script is actually sleeping and as you can see from his eyes they're closed he seems to be happy and he's sleeping now it's actually pretty late let's actually look at what Bob is doing oh wow Bob is still awake still chewing that bubble gum or maybe it's a new one I don't know but as you can see Bob is still trying to learn it seems he's still on his computer and it seems that the passing of time does not affect him he's just trying to learn he's still watching YouTube now let's actually see what Bob is doing so it looks looks like looks like my man Bobby boy is looking at a video on how he can animate death so this is actually a video on the animation editor and it looks like he's starting to learn about animation it seems like Bob is probably it seems that Bob is probably really really far ahead of script who's sleeping right here I mean this guy is sleeping this guy is over here watching a video on the animation editor huh maybe this guy's already learned all of scripting no doubt that Bob is a hard worker he's watching tutorials he's thinking about how he can impress his friends by creating animations and then using them in his games well we have someone that is very very lazy look at this lazy bum over here he is sleeping how could you be sleeping at a time like this you've got scripting to learn well I guess only time will tell right so looks like we're going to have to wait it out and let's look over here and another day is going to pass and actually what's happening is seven days are passing by right before our eyes seven days are going by just like that and now that a week has passed by it's going to be interesting to see what they're up to all right so now that a week has passed let's see what they're up to so over here we can see that no one is sleeping so that means that script must be doing something on his computer and it looks like he is he's over here look whoa he started to script seven days later this guy has actually started to code in Roblox it looks like he's actually doing something with that knowledge so it looks like he's watching some YouTube videos and then he's starting to code a little bit now let's see what Bob is up to I mean this guy he must like he must have won the Nobel Prize by now right I mean he was watching a whole lot of tutorials he must have known what he was doing looks like he's just starting to catch up with scripting looks like he's just starting to he's getting his handles on scripting so let's look at Bob whoa those eyes are humongous what happened to your gum okay so unfortunately Bob has run out of bubble gum that may or may not be a bad thing but let's see what he's doing so let's actually have a look seven ways to make 1 million Robo wow this guy is living the dream this guy must have he he must have already learned how to code he must be way better than him over here who's still getting a grasp on scripting this guy's learning seven ways to make a million robox this guy must have wow I mean I'm impressed Bob must have finished coding multiple games by now and he must be learning about the Roblox algorithm or something because now he's he's obviously set his sights a lot higher than just coding now he's trying to make money with it and a million Robux is $3,500 so this guy must be wow he has big dreams and I hope he gets it so now time is passing time pass time pass and it's night time and actually multiple days are going to pass let's actually say that a month is now passing so now as you can see there's a day and night cycle all right so a month has finally just passed it's currently 11:00 all right let's see what they're up to so it looks like it looks like script is coding so we're just going to let him cook and and let's look at what Bob is doing whoa Bob you seem upset what happened Bob seems absolutely worried what is he looking at is he like playing a horror game or something what he's looking at Studio Bob is this a new game I mean you've clearly made a lot of progress right right Bob no script no I haven't made any progress at all but what what what do you mean what do you mean you haven't made any progress at all I thought you you were just coding a whole bunch of games I spent all of my time watching YouTube tutorials and I didn't learn anything at all Bob that's what you were doing this whole time you were just watching tutorials yes I was only watching tutorials and I thought I was learning but I wasn't learning anything oh you mean you watched all of those Tut tutorials for the entire month and you just opened studio uh yeah oh okay well I mean Bob I don't know what to tell you you got to learn this stuff man you can't just watch videos watching videos on it doesn't mean you're learning it I know I know all right well I think it's better if we just leave these guys alone and we look at the time all right so now an entire year is passing by things are moving really quickly can't wait to see what they're up to all right so looks like script oh wow script looks like he's got his first game out would you look at that he seems that seems like he's got flying mechanics lock on camera a custom Mouse icon health bars he's got everything wow and he looks happy he looks happy he's got his first game out now let's actually look at Bob let's hopefully his situation has improved a little bit since last time oh wow Bob you look happy you look very happy what happened did did you figure it out I mean I don't really see a laptop but did you figure it out oh yeah I figured out the scripting is not right for me I figured out that that isn't really my thing and I just kind of stepped away from it oh okay okay I understand I mean scripting isn't for everyone so that's totally fine all right fast forward several several years later so now years are passing by a lot of time is passing by let's see what happens all right so now a ton of years have passed by and it looks like there's a school now huh okay so now we're going to actually look at what's going on inside the school oh whoa that's that's that's Bob but that's Bob and script in the same exact class and wa what is that that looks like a really fancy laptop this is a MacBook Pro and here's Bob looks like Bob is looking at script's screen and script is smiling away looking at something I wonder what it is looks like script now has a laptop upgrade and Bob is looking at script screen hm let's actually see what they're up to whoa whoa whoa hang on hang on what is this whoa this is this is a new game this is Battle me and it looks like Bob is looking at battlemania it looks like Bob is looking at battl Mania and he seems very interested and script is just as happy as ever oh my god did you make that I sure did this is this is my new game all right so some more time has pass and let's actually see what they're up to whoa so now there's actually a few people here and it looks like everyone is looking and they're all checking out script's game and it seems that they all want to play his game and here's Bob let's actually talk to Bob whoa I didn't know you could do that I want to learn a script too later that day so let's follow Bob and let's see where he is right now so no one's really sleeping in this bed looks like Bob is now oh now Bob is actually he's on a computer he's on a PC and and it looks like Bob is actually starting to use studio so after all of those years Bob is finally starting to use Studio I wonder where script is now H whoa script now has his own personal setup and everything and I assume this is because he committed to scripting for so long that he's able to afford all this stuff so as you can see both script and Bob both start started in a place where they wanted to learn the script but the outcome ended up very very different for both of them so why did things end up the way they did Bob made the big mistake and script didn't the first smaller mistake that Bob made is that he started with the goal of wanting to impress others but in the end script was the one that did all the impressing Bob was actually impressed by Script the initial goal that Bob had of wanting to impress others is called extrinsic motivation and what extrinsic motivation basically is is that he was motivated by something that was outside of his control like getting praised by his friends but script's goal was to be able to script anything that he wanted which is an example of intrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation means that he was motivated by his own desires that were deep within himself he had the drive to learn to script because scripting itself is enjoyable and rewarding so the first lesson is that you should learn to script because you like the act of scripting itself not because you're just chasing something like fame money or status now a fun fact is that intrinsic motivation is way stronger than extrinsic motivation the fame money and Status will eventually come if you stick with it for long enough but if the very reason that you want to learn scripting is because of those things it's going to be harder for you to stick with it for the long run so the lesson here is that you should try to make the act of scripting itself be the main thing that motivates you the main M biggest mistake is that Bob had information overload because he spent all of his time watching tutorials and not actually scripting script however jumped right into studio and began scripting right away and he kept improving over time while Bob on the other hand wasn't even able to start scripting much because he just kept watching video after video after video and never really did anything in studio the main issue is distraction when you're watching YouTube videos online you end up finishing one and immediately starting another because YouTube recommends really interesting videos so if you want the best chance of sticking with scripting over the long term and becoming one of the greats you have to eliminate this distraction one way you can do this is by getting off of social media and learning it somewhere else like with my beginner's guide to Roblox scripting book this book teaches you how to script from the very beginning with every line of code fully explained to you and guess what there are literally quizzes and practice exercises built inside the book so you know when you have to go into studio and actually practice it isn't like learning off of YouTube where there's tons of distractions left and right you just follow through the book do the quizzes and exercises and by the end you'll be able to script your own stuff if you're ready for your own copy check out the pinned Link in the comment section now another way you can eliminate distractions is by utilizing something called the Pomodoro Technique this is basically where you set a timer for 30 minutes and during those 30 minutes you can watch tutorials but the moment that timer stops you set another timer for 20 minutes and during those 20 minutes you go into studio and actually practice what you've learned then you do it again 30 minutes of tutorials 20 minutes of practice 30 minutes of tutorials 20 minutes of practice if you combine this technique with my book you will literally supercharge your learning if you found value in this video please make sure to like And subscribe I teach you how to become an awesome developer by telling stories just like the one you saw in this video I'll see you in the next video and be sure to comment which one do you think you're like right now are you more like Bob where you're just watching a bunch of tutorials and you're going to change the script or are you already like script where you're watching a few tutorials and then practicing it and then watching few tutorials and then practicing it see you later", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:18.052554",
