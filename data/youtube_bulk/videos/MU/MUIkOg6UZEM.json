on Roblox ever I just made the best code ever if it works I should sell it and make money I didn't know that scripting is so easy what what why does it work so bad I spent like 2 hours writing it no probably a Roblox Studio bug well too easy I am going to search other tutorial on YouTube oh hi there I don't know why I am here but it looks like you have a problem again that's right the last time you appeared of nowhere again again what the hell are you did you code this um yes I don't want to offend you but that's the most horrible code I've seen in my entire life are you learning to script or what yes and I think it's working I just need to learn slowly practice and don't give up so what are your methods to learn to script I watched a lot of YouTube you tutorials and I bought some random guys course for $80 I think it was worth it and uh I forgot and you think that you're going to learn just for doing that do you just follow the same toad just to copy paste it and suppose you're going to learn everything from a $80 course yes I think so well I think it's great to be here with you again could you tell me some tips of course I don't want an innocent creature like you to waste all your money and time just to learn a simple programming language actually it's not so simple but you can get it in a few days I think oh sorry I like to talk to myself be grateful that I am here I am going to save your time and money and mental health too just for the price of nothing just a little of your time actually really do I have to do something thing yeah just sit and pay attention it's so easy hey welcome to this video if you're watching this you're probably learning to script or you want to get better at scripting or maybe you're struggling to learn scripting and you feel like you're not learning anything despite watching a lot of videos or reading no worries you're in the right place because I'm going to show you five common mistakes people make when trying to learn don't feel bad if you recognize some of these mistakes in yourself it's important to see why you're not learning to script effectively you might just be wasting your time well enjoy the video this is a really common mistake I always see people skipping the basics because they're impatient to learn more or they just want to start doing things with a lack of knowledge but first what does skipping the basics actually mean imagine this little guy wants to create his first game but wait he doesn't even understand the Lewis impacts so he ignores it he has the brilliant idea of creating an amazing game but there's a problem he probably never heard of Loops variables or functions I think you already get it but he doesn't care again so what are the consequences this can lead to confusion in your project because you don't understand the basics of how to code in Lua so what do I recommend I'm glad you asked yourself read that's what I did I know it can be very boring I know but you could save many hours just by reading a little instead of watching those lowquality Roblox coding tutorials with the most unoptimized code ever you could use the Roblox documentation made by the Roblox Community or if you just want to learn the Lua syntax you could search the official Lua website and learn from there there's a lot of information on the internet so don't waste it this may be kind of controversial I'm not against people making coding tutorials on Roblox studio in fact thanks to Alvine blocks I learned to script so that's why I put on the title over Reliance if you're someone who watches Roblox Studio tutorials that's okay I'm not criticizing anyone anyway this is a common mistake for beginners who are starting to learn and want to keep learning maybe you watch many coding tutorials on Roblox Studio follow them step by step and start to feel like you are understanding but when the tutorials end your mind might go blank yeah I know most programmers have that feeling of what do I do now to tutorials are a great way to learn but you shouldn't depend too much on the person teaching you or make the mistake of just copying and pasting the code without even knowing how it works a simple solution is to experiment with coding start by creating small challenges for yourself remember programming is about logic so you don't need to memorize everything to understand how coding works but hey I'm not saying coding tutorials are bad just don't depend too much on them use them to learn new Concepts or to find solutions to specific errors it's simple you're probably not practicing enough you need to understand that programming or coding is a skill if you already play a musical instrument you know how many months or even years it can take to master it when you're learning you need to get familiar with the basics first start by writing everything functions variables debugging errors anything your brain needs to be trained so it could be stored in your memory in simple terms build your muscle memory but maybe you're thinking but like I said I practice a lot and even bought a coding course why am I not learning no worries I'll explain and help you find a solution you might be dealing with something called false sense of Mastery maybe you think that reading the Roblox documentation or watching video tutorials for one day is enough to learn how to code well that's totally wrong like I said before you need to guide yourself and also programming is logic use your brain and creative ways to solve problems when you're coding you might start feeling like you're going crazy not understanding anything but trust me it's worth it just take your time and learn slow slowly and I mean really slowly I've been coding for 7 years and I still forget some simple Concepts if you're tired of watching tutorials or reading endlessly or maybe you feel like your code is a mess or you can't find an error after hours of searching well I've got the perfect solution for you let me introduce the amazing Roblox Dev Community as you can see there's the dev Forum Community like it says it's a forum for Roblox developers where you can ask anything and if you don't speak English you can use the international communities great right just don't click on development discussion if you don't want to use the dev Forum you can always try Discord servers but in my opinion most Discord servers are well people might ignore you if you're a beginner anyway if you engage with a community you'll likely get help from more experienced developers or if you don't want to ask questions use the search bar to look for answers chances are many of the questions you have have already been answered there are plenty of talented developers helping beginners just be polite and don't ask questions like can someone help me make a script that works like a weapon but it's actually a rocket launcher that throws bricks at people and when they touch the bricks they explode and kill the player plus add kills to the leaderboard so you can earn money to spend in a shop with more weapons in yeah don't do that nobody's going to answer that question trust me this is important you need to know that good code needs to be clean readable and follow good practices why because if you want to hire people for your game especially scriptors and you ask them to do a simple task but they see your messy code they're probably going to be disgusted and won't want to work with you one common bad practice I see is using deprecated functions like weight and then I see developers defending it with something like um actually ignore that it's more optimized nice and less complicated duh man could you do a quick Google search and check what deprecated means yeah that read read a simple solution to avoid messy or unoptimized code is to start reading code written by other people analyze what makes their code clean and easy to read many developers use something called module scripts where they break longer functions into smaller ones this is a great way to make your code more readable also stay updated with robloxs changes one day roblocks could change a tiny detail that might break your entire code that's another reason why you shouldn't rely too much on older YouTube tutorials some might be 1 or 2 years old and trust me Roblox updates their programming language almost weekly having good coding practices is essential if you want to collaborate with others or get feedback on your code remember Roblox is an online game so having well optimized code is crucial for ensuring your players enjoy your game well I hope you've picked up some useful tips from this video the five mistakes I shared are some of the most frustrating ones and avoiding them can make a big difference in learning how to script effectively without wasting your time one of the most important things to remember is to take your time learning to script isn't a race you don't have to watch endless Roblox students tutorials either General programming tutorials are great and getting familiar with programming Concepts will really help you if you enjoyed this video I really appreciate a nice comment making these videos can be tough especially as a student your support means a lot", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:24.942467", "error": ""}
