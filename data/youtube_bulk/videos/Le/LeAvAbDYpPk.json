understand why something works rather than just knowing that it works the five fundamental parts of programming are variables conditionals functions loops and tables by mastering these you can pretty much do anything that you can think of but I'm going to give tables its own video now before we jump in this is how I'm going to format this series this is where most videos stop the last two parts are the most important part of the entire video I can't canot stress enough how important the challenges are also if you've already learned some of the concepts in this video feel free to skip to any of the time stamps I have set now let's hop in the studio so there are three panels you should always keep open we got the output properties and the Explorer so let's go and open up a script so to create a variable all you got to do is type local and you can name this variable whatever you want all it has to do is start with a letter of the alphabet three different data types we have are numbers and then we have strings which can hold a string of characters and then we have booleans that are holding a value of true or false so now to use these variables we've named it something string booleans and if we want to go ahead and use these we can go ahead and print them out print out numbers or wait no we got something string and booleans so now if we go ahead and run this you can see that it's printed 2013 the string and false which is exactly what we have these variables so right now these variables pretty much have no meaning you might wondering what are they even used for so let's give them some meaning so let's say we have level and let's say our level is three and we can go ahead and print level and it's three right here and then let's say right here we leveled up so we can do level equals level + 1 and now if we print level it's going to print four right here and so if I go and run this as you can see it prints three and then it prints four so we have edited um what was assigned to level and there's actually a simpler way we can do this we can um just do plus equals and then we can do one and that's the shorthand version of just writing level equals level + one now you can do this for any sort of um operations we have minus equal 1 and we have divide equals 1 and these are just the shorthand version of doing level equals level divid by one or minus or Plus or times so this isn't the only way we can modify variables we can have multiple variables or level uh we can call this one gain we can do six and we can modify level by using our new variable gain and so we can do plus equals gain and this right here is the shorthand version of doing level equals level plus gain and so now right here this is going to act as level equals 3 plus six and so it's going to be nine um if I get rid of this line and so if we try this out we should get nine in the output right there and so now level was incremented by gain so that's pretty much how numbers work let's go ahead and talk about strings so strings can be named anything you want I'm going to name mine super this is my username and you can go ahead and print these and print the output like we talked about but what if you wanted to edit this string there's many ways you can edit the string but the one way I'm going to go over for this video is we can do dot dot and we can add other strings to it so I can add is awesome and it's going to say super right here dot dot and it adds this is awesome and this right here is called concatenation whenever you add two strings together that is concatenation so if we run this as you can see it's going to print super is awesome it can cut any of the strings together and it printed it out so this right here doesn't actually edit the variable it's just um editing it inside this print and then it's going to print it out if we want to actually edit the variable you can do do do equals and we can add is awesome to it and so now if you print just Name by itself it's going to print the entire string this just look a little bit gross but it um that's just a short handwriting of name equals name dot dot is awesome and we can print this out and it's going to run twice super is awesome so let's go ahead and move on to conditionals I'm going to to find some basic variables to say I have coins of 500 and my level is 1 and now to do a conditional you can do an if statement and we can do coins and we can do greater than equals 100 then so if my coins are greater than or equal to 100 it's going to run inside this little block right here and so what I wanted to do is I wanted to add to my I want to add one and then I want it to take away from my coins 100 so now if I have more than 100 coins it's going to add one to my level and take away 100 coins and so at the very end of my program if I print level and I print the coins if I run this code you'll see that I'm level two and I have 400 coins now the next part to if statements is that we can also do else now this part right here runs whenever this statement is false so let's say I have five coins now this portion is not going to run I can say print to broke so now that I don't have over 100 coins if I run this program it should print to broke because I don't have enough coins let's go ahead and try and change this up a little bit let's say we have this Boolean called Ford now we can just take this right here and we can move that to a Ford and now we can just put if aord there because this is now Boolean we're setting it to the value of coins greater than or equal to 100 so if we print a forward it should either print true or false because this is a Boolean expression um and then it's going to check it down here and if it's true it's going to add level and if it's false then it's going to do two broke so as you can see it's false because we don't actually have enough coins also one way we can make our prints a little cleaner is you can actually do um some text here level and then you can C you can concatenate the level onto it and so now it's going to print level here we can do the same thing for coins if we wanted to we could do coins and then we could have the coins variable here and so now it's going to do level colon and then add level and the same for coins and let's go ahead and give us some coins so that we can run something so if we run this bullion's true because we can afford it our level updates to two and our coins change down to 150 so you can kind of start to see how these Basics are used all the time in games and how you really need to get these down to be able to do pretty much anything so let's go ahead and make this a little more complicated let's um let's add another variable call it Stone and let's give us around 100 there's more things we can do with booleans um there's things like and and or uh I'll just do those two for now so let's say we need both we both need to afford it and we need Stone to be greater than 50 so it needs to be 50 or greater if we want to buy it so now both of these booleans need to be true for us to be able to afford it um so now if we ran it at this point it would still work because we have 100 Stone but if we have or 50 Stone but if we have less than 50 Stone um as you can see it's going to say two broke we can afford it but we're too broke because we don't have enough Stone and so or this one works a little bit differently now if we have or just one side of this expression needs to be true and since a forward is already true um it's not even going to check this right here because it knows it's or and since this side's true it doesn't matter what this side is it's just going to run this program right here and it's going to work so if we have or as you can see we can afford it and it's going to change your level up and subtract coins now one more thing we can do with booleans is there's another keyword called not and so basically what that is going to do if parentheses around it it's going to take this Boolean whatever it results to not is going to flip it around so if this is true this is going to change it to false if this is false this is going to change it to true so if we run this program to see what happens it changed to false because we originally had 250 coins which is enough and it was true and it flipped it to false with not so that basically just inverts whatever Boolean it's tied to we can also chain these um if and else statements we can continue it on and we can add an if here so now it's an else if and there's this red line because we don't have a bullan expression here um so let's say this means that we can't afford it and we also don't have enough Stone so let's say we can't afford it let's go to 50 let's get rid of this knot so we can't afford it we also don't have enough Stone and let's say but we have at least 25 coins we don't have we don't have zero we have at least 25 25 to 99 is going to be in this range because we don't have any stone we're less than 100 coins but we have greater than equal 25 coins so right here we're going to print um some coins and then we can move this to the last else statement so now we can't afford it but we do have some coins um but we aren't like insanely broke so if we run this program afford is false but we do have some coins and level doesn't change coins don't change now I'm going to move on to functions at this point so let's go ahead and get rid of this and I'm going to define a function local function I'm going to give it a name uh let's call it buy and so press enter and here's our function everything inside this block and these right here here are the parameters so I'm going to make this the type of upgrade that you want to buy um so you just that's a parameter you can pass in to call this function you just type bu and then as you can see there's my variable parameter and I can pass anything on one side here I can pass in 10 and if I were to print type here this would be 10 and you can call this again um and so now it's going to print 10 and then it would print string so if I just test it out so you all can see we have 10 and string so now let's say I want to use this type to figure out which type of upgrade I want to buy so this will buy upgrade one this will buy upgrade two so I can do an if statement if type and to check numbers you're going to do equals equals that's how you can check numbers so if type equals one then we're going to do this um but if type is two then we're going to do this down here so uh this will be buy upgrade one and then this one down here will be buy upgrade two so if I to run this as you can see that one's going to buy upgrade one and this one's going to buy upgrade two um we could take us a little further we can do uh if we bought upgrade one it's going to increase our level by three and if we buy upgrade two this is going to increase the level by 10 so just to see that this works we can print level on both of these um and so our level starts out at one we call buy one we call buy two and our level is going to upgrade to four then it's going to upgrade to 14 because after this first upgrade it added three then after this second upgrade it added 10 to that so it went to 14 also functions don't need parameters you can just put them in if you want to so I just put a parameter in here also type is not a very good parameter name because it is also a keyword so just keep in mind of that uh I can change this to T to make it a little better um you can just name whatever you want but yeah it just doesn't need parameters you can do no parameters if you want you can still call it this will just be null because I'm not passing anything in and you can also do as many parameters as you want so these are all just variables like we've talked about um but they're defined by whatever you pass in right here so now T will be 1 a is 2 B is 3 and and C is 4 so that's how the parameters work also I don't know what's talking about this this just means that this side equals this side that's basically all that means so T equals equal 1 means that t is 1 that's what that means now the reason there's a tab after functions and if statements is because each of these things have a scope to it you can slightly see this gray line that goes down here and this right here is the scope of this if statement this right here is the scope of this one and this is the entire scope of this function so if I were outside of the scope like over here and I tried to print a as you can see there's going to be a red line and it would air because this a only exists inside of the scope also one other thing the variables everything is only defined after the fact that you define it because it runs top down so if I tried to print level above level as you can see there's a red line because level currently does not exist the thing I'm going to go over for functions is um the return statement so if I had let's say a function that gets a color and I pass in a choice now I can check this Choice let's say the choice is one it's going to run inside here and if the choice is two then it's going to run here we have a return statement and what this is going to do is it's going to send back Valu to whatever called the function so let's say I have two different options here I have blue and green and now down here I can actually use this value let's say the color equals we're going to call the function get color and we're going to choose option one so now if I print color um and run this notice it prints blue so it actually returned this value back to where it was called from so how this runs is it runs we on line 10 go to line 11 color equals get color one so it goes up here passes in one it runs here oh we find out Choice equals 1 it returns blue we go back to here now color equals blue and then I printed it out one thing about return is that as soon as return is um used inside a function whever it's used it's going to immediately exit the function so if I had farther code down here and say I print something at the end of the function it's never actually going to reach this print because it returns either here or here so if I ran this code as you can see it prints blue but it doesn't print um something uh the only way this would actually print is say I got a color that was three it's not going to reach any of these options so it never returns and it just prints something and color should print uh nil so I printed something and I printed nil because no color was actually returned so nil value was set to color now the last thing I want to go over before I put everything together is loops and Loops have a start and they have an end and I'm going to go ahead and Define these as variables you don't need to Define them as variables and to start loop we're going to create a new variable and I'm going to name mine increment and we're going to Define it to be start to the end which is STO for me and then you end it with two and so now if we go ahead and print this out I'm going to print out increment this is the new variable we defined it's going to start here and it's going to stop here by default it's going to increment by one um a better way of doing this is iteration actually this will be an iteration and this is going to demonstrate what's happening in this Loop every iteration is going to print this right here whatever this equals so if I go ahead and run this you'll see it'll print 1 2 3 4 5 because it started at one and stopped at five these variables represent what each part of a loop is um um but the most traditional way is you have 4 I equals and then you choose some numbers here and this will do the exact same thing as before so if I go ahead and run this you'll see it 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 now this next part of a loop is what really opens up the bounds of what we're allowed to do so this is the start this is the end but there's a third number that you can put in and this is an increment so I could change this to three and this is what it's going to increment by so if I change this to do something like s and if we do print I and if I go ah and run this you'll notice it prints 1 47 and that's because it's now incrementing by three so you might be wondering at this point what happens if our start number is higher then our end or what if we have our end at 8 and it since it increments by three it's never going to reach eight it'll go from 7 to 10 and how it works is it's going to start at 1 and and then it's going to do the loop well it's first it's going to check is one less than 8 and if it is it does the loop and once it gets back it does it over and over and over and as soon as it realizes it's greater than the stop it's going to immediately stop after this increment um and it's going to check immediately from our starting number so if I had 98 it's not going to do anything as you can see nothing prints in the output and like I said if it starts at 1 it should stop at 7 because after it adds to 10 it realizes it's going to be p eight so it's not actually going to do anything with that but if this were at seven it would still do the exact same thing I would have to change it all the way to 10 if I want to see a difference also if you didn't already realize it's going to run from top down so if I printed something up here then first this prints then the loop runs and if I had something beneath it say this where the end um it's going to print start it's going to print all of the loop and then after it's done with Loop then it's going to and then you and print end at the very end and it's going to run all the code that is down here so it's going to run top down so if for R this just for example start and then ends right after this can get complicated really fast I have to add some more things into it before I go into that there's one more thing um about these Loops is I is a variable like normal but if I tried to add five to it you would think it's going to first start at one add five so it's at six then it prints six then it adds three then it'll be nine and then it does it again and it's going to past 10 so it's only going to print twice you would think but if I go ahead and run this you'll notice that print 6 9 12 and 15 and this is because these Loops um they're predefined and whenever you edit I it's not actually going to do anything um so it's going to take one add five to it it's going to take three add five to it and or four and add five to it and so on and it's not actually going to change the structure of how the loop already runs this is different from other programming languages where when you edit I it will actually change the way the loop runs it won't just be immediately defined up here you can usually edit it inside the loop but in Roblox you just can't do that now Loops is where we can use two um new keywords so let's make an if statement let's say I equal 4 um and we can do something like continue and this is a new cool keyword that we can use so I'm going to print I down here how this going to work is it's going to start at one it's less than 10 so it's going to run and it's going to check is I4 it's not going to be four so it prints one and then it goes back now it's going to be four and when it gets uh to this continue keyword what continue does is it skips the rest of the loop and it starts back at the next increment so as soon as I equals 4 it skips everything and it immediately increments it to seven and then it continues again so if I ran that for an example as you can see it skipped four because I put continue on it and it just skipped the rest of the loop the last keyword I'm going to show you is called break so if I replace this with breake it's similar to continue but it's going to instead of go back to the next iteration it's going to immediately break out of the loop so if I ran this it's going to only print one and it just exits the loop because once it equals four it breaks and it stops if I change this to 7 and I ran this as you can see it prints 1 4 and at seven it exits the loop and just continues code down here now I'm going to try one more complicated thing I'm going to do a loop inside of a loop and I'm going to make these the same increment and for now I'm just going to make it print um the values so it's going to print I then it's going to print all of J then it's going to print I and just so it doesn't get confusing I'm going to add um this string right here so you can tell what is what so if I put this here change the I now let's go a and run this and as you can see in this output uh if I go to the very top I is 1 then it prints J all the way 1 to 10 then I is 2 1 to 10 I is 3 all the way down till I is 10 and it prints J 1 to 10 so you can easily calculate um how many times this runs so I runs 10 times J runs 10 times inside of I so in total it runs runs 100 times now that we have a rough understanding of the fundamentals I'm going to uh create something rather fun for us so let's say this represents X and this represents z um I'm going to get rid of these prints I'm going to generate a grid using these coordinates so let's say I pass in an X and the Z value and we haven't gone over this I'll explain it in a second but let's say we have a part and it's going to equal instance. new and I'm going to create a part and now with this part I'm going to just set it size to um we'll do one one and then I'm going to set its position um to a new vector and it's going to be x and z I'm going to put it uh this guy I forgot there's three okay and I'm going to set the parent to be game. workspace so now this creates a part and it's going to set the size to a 1x one by one tiny little block and it's going to change the position to be this x coordinate I pass in the Z coordinate I pass in and five studs however high that is then it's going to set the pair in workspace so we can actually see it and now all I'm going to do is I'm going to create a part in every single iteration so at the end this is going to create 100 parts if I pass in x and z uh one more thing so the parts don't fly everywhere is I'm going to Anchor them uh so I'm going to set anchor to true so they don't just fall out of the sky so if I go and run this um as you can see I have this uh grid right here and I can select each of these parts these are all separate parts and I generated this grid by using this Loop and a function now to explain how this works we've gone over Loops we've gone over functions this is called for every iteration of Z and this entire Loop is uh run for every iteration of X so this is Run 100 times with each unique coordinate of x and z now in this iteration this right here is instance. new instance. new just basically lets you create anything you want so if you go in the workspace and press this little plus sign you can create any of these things inside instance. new so if I wanted to create a tool or a folder inside a script I could just type folder and here is my folder right here um since I don't want to just create it and not be able to use it I assign it to a variable so now this variable equals this new part I created now that I have access to it I can edit it however I want um so if I have a part and you click on this part we have these this properties page um and it has all these properties we can change and how we can change those is all we have to do is go part and Dot the property you want to change and then you can just change it and set it to New value um so size uses a vector 3 so I have to pass in a new Vector 3 which is X Y and Z and then position is another Vector 3 but this one I want to use x and z because this one I want to change based on whatever I pass in and then anchored just means I can change it anchored so it's either false or true it either has physics or it doesn't um and then I Chang the par to workspace cuz if I didn't do that this would just be a random part in code and it wouldn't have a parent so it wouldn't exactly it wouldn't exist anywhere in the Explorer because I didn't assign it to a parent um so this part right here the parent is the workspace if I moved it here the parent would be the base plate now I'm going to try and make something a little bit cooler to open your eyes to the possibilities um so let's go ahead and make 100 um X so it's going to go I have 100 parts in The X extraction and let's make this a little bit fancier we can use math and there's a bunch of math functions we can use but one I'm going to pick is I'm going to use sign I'm going to put X inside there and I'm going to offset it off the ground by 10 so it's 10 studs in the sky plus whatever the sign value is so as it um goes across the X it's going to produce this uh sign offset based on whatever the sign value is it could be like negative 1 to positive 1 and so with that we should get this really cool wave of effect so if I run this code as you can see there's this nice little sine wave of Parts as the X changes and if I wanted to make it smoother I could divide this by five so now it's going to have a less like it's going to change across the wave slower because X is now a fifth of whatever the value was so now if run this code as you can see we got this nice smooth wave and as you can see we can create a lot of really cool things with this this um just to see what happens we could say try also adding let's do Z and see what happens when we do that if you run this code we get this really cool effect where it's tilted on the z-axis and if I want to see a little bit more of what's going on here I can make it go faster and let's also make it go five times farther in the Z Direction and now we have this really cool grid wave effect going on here where it's ALS it's changing both in the X Direction and the Z Direction and this really cool wave effect now I'm going to take it one step further and I'm going to change the color um so there's a few different ways you can change colors we have new. from RGB HSV but the one that's going to suit me best for this is HSV so HSV represents H saturation value and H is the value that goes across so this is like a rainbow effect saturation is how much of the color we have so it goes to White and to the full version of that color so this is high saturation this is low saturation and then we have values this is how bright it is so we go all black all the way back to the color so I'm going to try and create something cool also you realize it ranges from 0 to 1 so this is zero this is one and same with saturation and value so I like 7 for saturation so I'm going to use 7 for saturation and value and I'm going to try and make a cool Rainbow effect since it only ranges from 0 to 1 um I'm going to take x and z and I'm going to divide it by let's say 200 so it's never it's never going to reach something cu the highest value we have is 150 so it's never going to reach one which means it's not going to break the bounds and we're just going to add x and z together divide it by 200 so now as x and z increases it's going to go across the rainbow so if I try this out you'll see that starts around zero which is red and we have this nice rainbow effect going across our wave of parts now this last thing we to go over is while Loops so with while Loops it's going to take a Boolean expression and while this Boolean expression is true it's going to run the code inside the while loop and as soon as it turns false it's going to exit the while loop so if I put while true here it's never going to exit the while loop because there's no possibility of X in the while loop but it works the same as continue and break so if I ever put continue inside this while loop it's going to skip the code and go to the next iteration and if I ever put break it's going to exit the Y Loop no matter what and it's going to continue the code after the loop um so if we have a loop that runs forever it is going to be a little bit dangerous you could crash your program so one way we can do this is we can put weight up here and this will weight the smallest amount possible uh if you want to go a little bit smaller you can do test. weight doesn't really matter too much though uh this will act as a true statement and it'll run forever but it'll also weight the smallest amount possible so it doesn't try to run a billion iterations as fast as possible so now with this while loop I'm going to do some experiments um using this for now I'm just going to use this uh spawn plate um just so I don't to create a part and I'm just going to do some fun things with it so Insider while loop first I'm going to gain access to this spawn location so I can change it and do things to it so I'm going to create a variable for it and this variable is going to equal this spawn location so do game. workspace and spawn location is a child of workspace so to access it all I do is Dot and spawn location and the parent of spawn location would be the workspace so I could do parent do spawn location and that would be the same thing though that is redundant now that we have this spawn location I'm going to go ahead and try something out let's go ahead and change the position let's say we want to increment the position by a vector 3 and let's move it along the X Direction by 01 studs and we're going to change nothing else so position equals position plus this new Vector 3 is going to move move along the extraction by 01 studs as fast as it can um waiting this much per change so if I run this as you can see our spawn location is slowly moving in the X Direction I'm going to try one other thing let's say I Define t = 1 I'm going to try and rotate the spawn so T is going to represent a rotation and I'm going to make it increment by one every iteration and and so this is going to be 1° and I want it to rotate all up to 360° and go back to zero and rotate 360° again so one way you can do that is we have this percent operation so I could do tal T percent 360 so what this does is takes three divides it by 360 and then it's the it equals the remainder so if I had 5 / 360 the remainder is 5 because it can't divide and five as the remainder if I have 360% 360 um then it's going to take 360 360 there's no remainder because it equals 1 and so it would equal zero so then T once it equals 360 it resets to zero which is exactly what I want if you had something like 365 uh% uh 360 this would result to five because I have a remainder of five um and the name for this percent sign is modulus or modulo so that's what people call that and so this is going to increment T all up to 360 resets to zero all up to 360 and it just continues that forever now I'm going to do the rotation aspect using our new T that constantly increments from 1 to 360 so C frame is similar to Sy position but this represents rotation also so I want to change rotation position doesn't have rotation attached to it and I want to change rotation so I'm going to set it to a new C frame but I want to change it to the spawn position so now this C frame is a C frame that represents the spawn the position of it but it strips it of any rotation that it has because as you remember position is a vector 3 it has no rotation so this new C for create has no rotation now I want to rotate it with my new T value so to do that we're going to multiply our C frame by an angle and I'm going to rotate it in the X Direction and this takes radians so I want to convert my degree to radians CU I'm using degrees 1 to 360 um and I'm going to convert that to a radian and then I'm going to rotate it nothing in the other directions this is just going to rotate in the X Direction by as 3° so now if I go and try this out you'll notice that it's rotating along the X Direction and it's spinning in a circle um and I'm going to go ahead and try another direction if I try the y direction spin in two directions and so as you can see now it's spinning a little chaotic it's spinning both the Y Direction and The X Direction at the same time you can do a lot of cool things with this now this video is already around 35 minutes long and I don't want it to go on forever from first video so I have set up four different levels of challenges for youall to do after this tutorial um so here's the first one it's this staircase we have four parts and it just goes up one stud as it goes up so you try and generate this using the script the second one is a cube that slowly changes colors Over the Rainbow and repeats it forever and then this one does the same thing but it's moving in a circle forever and and then this one is just a generated circle using a bunch of parts and it generates a full circle so those are the four challenges I have set up for you guys and the goal for these challenges is for you to be able to write each program on your own um by yourself without using any help uh and this is just inspiration I've set some different difficulties if you want to try to progress as much as you can um you should be able to do each of these with just the tutorial I have given you and I will give the solutions to each of these challenges uh for the code I wrote in my next video so youall can see how I did it if you didn't figure it out or if you just want to see how you differed from mine also if anything was confusing you could join the Discord that's linked to my channel and ask any questions there I'd be happy to answer the last time I asked you all to subscribe I went from eight subscribers to 800 subscribers so if you all do that again i' be 80k now but seriously 99% of you aren't subscribed and if you want to see more content from me just let me know by interacting in any way you want and I'd very much appreciate that see you guys in the next one and thanks for watching",
