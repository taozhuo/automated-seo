"roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "so a few years ago I was looking at games on Roblox until I got the idea to make my own game but there's one issue I don't know how it script so I decided to spend the next 7 Days learning how script so I can make a Roblox game starting off on day one I decided to find some videos and after a couple of hours I made it pretty far into Alvin Block's scripting series now at this point I was getting ready to end day one but I came across another video by album blocks which looked interesting so here's a timelapse of that now at this point I was done the map and I thought it was looking pretty good however I still need this script and after some time I finished the first script what it does is guess the player when they join and then guess the player's character and changes some properties within the character hemoid then the script will Loop through the player list every second and if the player's character exists it'll add one jump power to the player's humanoid now at this point all I have left to do was make a UI and script it so it shows the player's jump power and just like that I was done and I was ready to test the game and it didn't work so I went to the output and went to the script that had the ear and it was pretty obvious what I needed to be delete it but for some reason I decided to add an extra equal sign I guess not even my pebr follow simple tutorials anyways as soon fixed the script and the game was working now at this point I decid to end day one as May losss of progress which brings us to day two to start off the second day I decided to watch some more scripting videos so I continued watching alen Block's scripting series and after a couple of hours I made lots of progress anyways day three is when things got interesting since I created the scripting test real which is where I planned on storing the rest of the projects I worked on throughout the rest of the challenge after I started watching a video by a cyber career on click detectors and after some scripting I made it so some properties of the ball changes whenever you click on it but for for some odd reason I started humping the ball anyways I soon got back to scripting and made it so that whenever you hover over the ball the transparency of the ball changes to 0.5 once I go back to scripting I decided to make my own function so I started working on a function that would spawn apart at a random position in the sky whenever he right click the ball now for some reason I didn't put local in front of the variables and instead put them in the parameters of the function but don't worry because I fixed my mistake and surprisingly there's no errors with the function I then made it so that whenever a player touches the ball it print the name of the player that touched it and just like that it was day four on day four I came across two videos B Mo events made by gnome code and the dev King I then spent the next hour trying to get remote events to work but I encountered lots and lots of bugs well there was only two bugs but they were still bugs anyways I finally fixed the bugs and the remote V was working so whenever I press you the transparency of the part would change I didn't start watching another video by gnome call making a shift to Sprint system and just like that it was working and I was zooming around the the map the last thing I did for day four was started watching a video by it's Floppy Fish on making Jui hover effects however I was starting to get tired so I only made the base ji now at this point you're probably expecting day five but I was extremely busy so I wasn't able to get any work done on day five and day six however although I was still busy on day seven I was only able to start working once the challenge had officially ended which was at 400 p.m. but I wanted to at least finish the Jui effects so I started working on a script that had two functions which would control the ji size I then assigned each function to the most enter mouse Le function so that whenever you hover your mouse over the ji it size will increase by 1.1 and the ji was working I then started eying on to the two functions so that the color of the button would change whenever your mouse hovered over it and then mixed up the colors so the button turns red whenever your mouse stops hovering over it when it's supposed to do the opposite I then went back to the script again to fix my mistake and add some sound effects which will play whenever your mouse is hovering over the button however I want to have my own twist so I started working on jump scare that will have a one in 10 chance of playing whenever the player clicked the button anyways Here's the final product well that is going to be it for this video and I do apologize for having nothing to show for day five and D6 but anyways thanks for watching and consider subscribing if you enjoyed the video and I'll see you all next time
