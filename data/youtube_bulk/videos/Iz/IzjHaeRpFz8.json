"query": "roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "we also have secret which at this point I just think Roblox is trolling us like this this cannot be a real thing this thing has literally stolen The Souls of so many developers I can't even start counting the main thing that makes Roblox stand out from stuff like Unity um you know God dot Unreal Engine 5 is that Roblox is stupid which leaves developers confused not because it's like you know complex or anything cuz it's not complex right it's really simple but just because it has basically no patterns and the moment it actually starts forming a pattern and you can somewhat follow it it just breaks it off completely because most developers look for patterns so they're like okay well if this does this thing well then this similar thing probably does a similar thing and Roblox like somewhat somewhat follows this until it just says actually no you so I'm going to start with what I know for a fact every single person who's ever touched Roblox Studio has experienced and it's basically just the fact that a model is as far away from a model as you could possibly imagine if you look at a model's description right and even just using common sense it says uh they group objects together right so for parts and everything so you might be saying okay well if I make several parts and I want to make them into a model so we have a part over here and then we have a part over here right look at my beautiful creation okay it's very nice the issue is if I actually play the game they fall right and I don't want that to happen I want all of them to be grouped together because then if they fall they're going to fall all together as one model right so then I can just you know right click group as a model perfect does that fix the problem haha okay but like I'm sure that models probably have like some scripting functionality cuz you know otherwise isn't a model just a glorified folder cuz you know you can put items and folders and you can put items and models so what's the big difference and that's what every beginner thinks right so they you know they put a script inside of the model and then you know they make a variable for the model so local script. parent the only thing that you can do with a model is move it to something which you might say okay that's actually really nice right so we can give it a you know X Y and Z coordinate so let's say 0 10 0 so it's going to move it above the spawn location okay so you might be thinking okay at least it does something right but just give me a second okay because I'm going to show you something right now and then we're going to come back to this move to function and then I'll show you why literally no one likes using it ever so remember how I told you how like oh yeah if I run this game then the models all fall or rather I should say how do we make it so that they still fall but as one individual part because as you can see when I actually hover my mouse over it the outline seems to suggest that this is all one part right so what you have to do is you have to find a part that's supposed to be like the primary part so models have this thing they have a property called primary part so let's say the primary part is going to be the one at the bottom what you then have to do is you have to add in a weld constraint for every other part so there's two parts so we need two weld constraints and then the weld constraint needs a part zero and a part one with part zero being you know the part that they're under like so and then part one being the other parts so for the first weld constraint it's this part for the second weld constraint it's this part and when you do it like this then yeah there we go and it's like okay that works I guess but what's the point of the model then I you know what I could do you know what I could do I could make a folder right now I'll do it right now out of spite out of pure spite wow wow guys would you look at that and remember how I told you how we're going to come back to move two and why it's bad what I'll do is I'll anchor all of these parts that you know they're not like affected by gravity and so what I've just done is I just wrote some code which basically just means that every 1 second we're going to clone this model okay and then we're going to move it to Vector 010 0 right so what you would expect is like okay it's going to clone this model it's going to move it to the you know Vector 0 10 0 and then because the model is anchored it's just going to stay there so then when it makes another model it's going to put that model inside of the previous model and so on and you know what happens move two it doesn't the issue with move two is that it does not allow models to go inside another model which might seem kind of obvious to you like oh yeah what's the problem with that but the issue is like when I give it concise coordinates I want it to be at these exact coordinates right and so what move 2 does is it just says haha no you can't and it just this isn't what position what position is this model at 0580 it's 48 studs off the next thing is the heavy confusion of server versus client and this is something I actually talked about in a couple of my recent videos right the main idea of server versus client is that client is how you perceive the game while the server is basically just a neutral overview of the game so in a real Roblox game the client is basically ran by your device right while the server is ran by actual Roblox servers but the issue here is that sometimes both of these don't show exactly the same information and let me show you what I mean right if I just take this model right now and I just delete it and then I go to with the server the model is still there it's still a thing right but then for me the model stopped existing if you're confused about this do have like a couple other videos you could watch after this one but let me show you why this messes up a lot of games right let's say for example okay for example I just had a script and then let's say that okay every 1 second we're going to you know get the workspace do model um like so and then we're just going to set its name okay to be equal to model obviously this is a stupid change that does nothing but like let's assume that this is a real game and like this is a very important change that we're trying to make and so now that I'm playing this game okay the script is being ran now we don't see anything happening but the fact that we aren't getting any errors means that everything's working fine right now if I go to my client right and then I you know delete this model like so the model doesn't exist anymore but the script isn't giving us any errors right but then if I go on the server we can see like okay the model is still here right and then if I delete the model then it's going to yeah model is not a valid member of workspace now in this example this isn't like really a big problem but I would have so many moments where like I would have a server script and let's say I was looking for the model and then it's like I would play the game and I'd be on my client and I would check the workspace and I would see the model but then the script would tell me like oh yeah but model doesn't exist and I was so confused and it legit took me like an hour of browsing Google to even learn what server was and then I click on the server and then you know it that doesn't have the model and then I'm kind of like okay this kind of makes sense now right but I have seen a bunch of developers being confused about this like bro like it's saying that model isn't a valid member but uh I I can see the the model right here right uh why isn't why is it giving me an error it's because it's on the server so click on the server fix it and yeah another very heartbreaking Discovery is that you have to manually save people's data because you know how Roblox has these like leaderboards on the top right where it like shows how much cash the player has let me actually script that right now so I'll show you exactly what I mean so like if I play the game right now right and I go on the server the way it works is that the player needs to have a folder inside of them called leader stats so exactly called leader stats right and then inside of that folder you add number value right so I can name this like cash and then I could set this to like 100 or whatever right and then what that's going to do is it's going to show you this leaderboard and so what a lot of people do right is they basically just check whenever a player actually you know joins their game so you know they get the player everything and so then what they do is they just make a folder you know put it inside the player and then they make an in value and put that inside of the folder right so then what happens is that when the player joins the game there you go they have their nice leader set value if let's say on the server right they have like a thing where like let's say if I click on this model I get 10 cash for example right so then value goes up to 10 okay there we go now I have 10 value and then if I leave the game okay so I leave the game and then I come back to play the game my value is back at zero I've seen so many questions about this like oh why isn't my value saving am I supposed to publish the game to Roblox and no you don't have to publish your game to Roblox all you have to do is write this script which I will say that I teach this script and B basically everything we're going to cover in this video inside of my course which you can find in the description blah blah blah now these ones were confusing but like they make a lot more sense when I actually talk about them right like okay yeah it makes sense you know why the data doesn't save or you know why the models aren't working somehow but then this next one is legitimately just a waste of time I have no idea why they have this here I I I genuinely have no clue what Roblox was smoking they have two colors actually confused the hell out of me it's like it doesn't seem that important like okay well yeah you have two colors just pick one and it doesn't like seem that important like like maybe you're thinking okay maybe brick color is for the actual like you know brick and then maybe color is for like the material right but it's not if I change the brick color to be like sign or whatever it changes the color if I change the color it then changes the brick color these two are literally coexisting for no real reason and what makes it worse is that the brick color is literally just a worse version of color because how it works right is that it has this you know little color spectrum and every color has its own unique name so so inside of a script I could say like okay parts. brick color equals seashell or I could say parts. brick color equals Mulberry right so basically if I'm using a brick color I am limited to using these colors only but then if I'm using Color I literally get the entire color wheel and the only difference here is that instead of having a fun name like toothpaste it just uses RGB values what a lot of beginners find confusing is scripting in general which I know kind of makes sense right but then you have stuff like co- routine I specifically remember watching like a beginner Roblox tutorial like 3 years ago right and this guy literally 20 minutes in just says like hey hey guys by the way uh we're going to use a co- routine but I'm not going to explain so you know just just so I literally just copied and pasted his code and then my code just ended up being full of co- routines and I had no idea what these do co- routine. yield or co- routine is yieldable because for the most part scripts are fairly simple like okay you know you have local variables and you you can assign them to numbers and then you know you have loops and then if if you want to change the property of something well then you know you say workspace and then you get that you know thing but here it's like what's an enum bro en. humanoid display distance type what does this mean and there's a lot more stuff right we got um you know PE calls uh we got XP call which you know I don't even know what that is we also have secret which at this point I just think Roblox is trolling us like this this cannot be a real thing and if scripts weren't confusing enough the next thing which is stupid which is also purple just like this model is something called a module script unlike a regular script this script does nothing okay basically it just has like a table and then it just returns a table and then the idea is that you can like put functions and variables inside of this table and then from any script you can basically get this table and then you know use the variables and functions inside of this table but where did they get confusing for developers is it's like I said before a lot of beginners they want to understand why something is done because when you're confused by something it's just because you don't know what that thing does you don't know the purpose behind that thing and it's the same with module scripts you might be asking right now like oh yeah why do I need a module script like why do I need to have a table here where I could just make a table here you could literally take this code right you can just copy it over here and you can just do the same thing just instead of returning the module you just have it in your script right so you can just say like oh yeah module. new function is equal to you know function and then you make your function and then this this is what people do in module script right so so instead of doing this here and then having to you know call like um require on it which is how you get the table why couldn't you just do all of this inside the actual script now the answer is that like yeah like these things are valuable because it's just one table that can be full of like a bunch of functions cuz let's say for example you have like um a game based around abilities right and let's say you have like five of these scripts that need to actually access a table of like functions that perform these abilities and you could just copy the table in inside all of the five scripts or you can just have this table be inside of this module script and then whenever you actually need to access the table you can just say like local module is equal to require and then you get the module so in this case it's inside of our script so we'll just say script. module script and then yeah from there you can just have module and then you can just access whatever is inside the table the second to last confusion is this idea of player versus character to sum it up this is your character okay this is your actual physical presence in the game but then the thing is what if I respawn okay what if I what if I reset my character right well then for a split second my character stops existing right like he he kind of still exists but there's like a split second where my character gets deleted and so obviously in that little moment where my character is deleted Roblox still needs to know that I'm actually playing the game so the way Roblox handles this is that your character is inside of the workspace so it's a model right it has like you know your all of your accessories your humanoid it has all of these you know parts so I can delete my head and then that kills me right so that probably wasn't a good idea but then if you want to get the actual player well then you go to players right and then this is my player which contains all of the actual like data right so it has my you know player user interface it contains my player scripts it has like the backpack which is like your inventory and then the player itself contains stuff like what the character is right uh the character appearance ID the display name I'm just saying right because if you ever want to like teleport you know the player's character somewhere the way you do this is you just change the position of their humanoid Roots part right but then like I would tell this to people and then you know what they do they would like send me a script of like oh am I doing this right and the script was like game. players. the original lamp. humanoid root part. position and then the script would tell them like oh uh the player doesn't have a humanoid root part and then they would send me a screenshot and then they would be like uh it's saying that there's no humanoid root part but it's like in my game they clearly have a humanoid root part and I'm like bro you're accessing the player not the character and the last but definitely not least confusion is user interface okay this thing has literally stolen The Souls of so many developers I can't even start counting you know you got buttons you got labels and everything right and then you have a viewport frame I'm not even about to start explaining what this thing does you have a video frame okay and if that wasn't bad enough if you just want a button right okay you can move it around you know very nice and then let's say you want to change the size right X and Y scale and offset what the hell is scale what the hell is offset right oh what is this oh when when I lower the screen the button isn't scaling along with the screen how do I fix that well I need to change the scale oh but then what what is offset what is scale and the scariest part is that that's actually like the easiest thing to learn about GUI eventually you're going to start working with like UI page layout that's when you're going to start to like appreciate user interface in games a lot more but hopefully this video convinced you to start Roblox development if this video unironically made you want to start developing Roblox Studio the first few lessons of my course are actually free to watch so if you want to get like an actual highquality and modern guide to Roblox studio and not like a stupid beginner tutorial where some guy's talking to about like oh co- routines haha co- routines then click on the top Link in the description or maybe not top link I don't know it's going to be one of the links and yeah you know if you want to reward me for my 3 years of suffering with this terrible application I do quite like the idea of having a silver play button so if this video helped you then you know feel free to subscribe and as always we are Back to Basics thank you for watching",
