"roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "I'm tired of you guys making fun of me because I can't script so I'm going to spend the next 24 hours learning the script if you ever came across my channel before you would notice I use AI a lot my biggest video is me using Ai and I use AI because I can't script so why not just learn scripting you got lit than 24 hours it should be easy you only got 24 hours right you literally only have 20 okay I get it ever since a small little box I wanted to make video games but I didn't really understand what went into making a game and I didn't want to learn everything so I procrastinated and procrastinated and procrastinated up until 1,100 and 93 days ago I made my first game it was not a good game but it started my Roblox Game Dev Journey on this day I attempted to make my first game it was supposed to be a piggy Style game called Bella but I gave up on it cuz I didn't know how to make a menu and at the time I was like 12 so my brain was not developed yet and it's still not on this day I de started to make my at the time dream game but all it was was a trash Obby you had a knife and a gun to kill people while you're completing the Obby because you're trying to race to get the golden gun it sounded cooler in my head in the game I had this wall of cool it was just a wall with my friend avatars and yes this is me I had drip not going to lie hold up go back a little bit all right stop here you might wonder why it took almost a oneyear break well it's because I didn't know how to script so I'm doing this for the old me to get our brain worked up and see how much I already know let's do a little quiz this parent is part uh what would you do oh oh oh I'm stupid what's the name of the oh oh hold up I know something got 1 minute left 90% accurate now that my brain is nice and warmed up I think it's time for me to try and script something disclaimer I'm not a script my scripting is bad I'm really slow so if you laugh at me I'm going find you and kill you enjoy okay so now I'm trying to script without learning anything yetay I'm going trying to make this part if you touch it it deletes or something like that loal part equals um what's local part equals okay so this is kind of embarrassing but when I started this I just woke up so my brain was still stupid script. parent uh 2,000 years later I L know nothing about scripting a few moments later after what felt like forever I got it to work Bingo it's easy I'm him I know how to script now after that minor success no Diddy I tried scripting another part here's the script if you want to see it I'm not sure if I did good or not let me know even know if yaen it's time to start the actual challenge to learn scripting I'm going to use BR dev's basic scripting Series so let's get started young little Newber doesn't know anything about game developmental guide we're going to use this Bas play template right here this template that we just selected then we can see that there's actually stuff so I'm kind of just moving this part around a little bit so um so far I learned nothing the next video on the series was to learn printing not the flex or nothing I already know how to print ladies please keep your pants on I know I'm just so talented it's 1 hour in I'm going to try and make a game you know The Fall Guys game hexagon I'm going to remake that but in like 9 minutes this should be easy so first I made a tile then I made a lot of tiles then I deleted the tiles and had one tile the scripting part was pretty easy but I still took a long time because you know my brain is um not the fastest but I ended up getting it to work and now all I got to do is duplicate the tiles wee now we got a working hexagon game who said scripting was hard now that we just learn about now that we just learn about functions it's time to actually script a function I already no this about functions so it's not that hard for me to do it boom make a script local function box heads boom script. parent and now if I play the game Sid right here side going to go down side's going to go up and siid back down I already told you I know about scripting so I'm like that good I'm goated bro I told my brother to give me something simple to script and it's what he said um B flickers when you touch it flickers let me put that in English he wants me to make a ball that flickers when you touch it ball script done I don't want to say it again but honestly scripting is way too easy to make the video not just me doing tutorials let's do this random game I found back yeah I'm not with check out I just made the lapop take a snap you at first I was a little confused I was like what is this this a even teaching me scripting then I realized it was using built-in functions and not teaching me scripting oh yeah let's make Arnold get that bag he want that money for real yeah good job aror so proud of you I'm arold one of the only subscribers on youtube.com breaking news Arnold box head reported missing after recording his part for the only Box's video If you see or hear anything from him please content 3-4 7-3 or text us said haha Arnold got taken subscribe by the way that game lowkey click baited me player. move forward does not exist all not going to lie this is too much work arold you got this yes master freak freak freak freak I don't know what I'm doing arold cooked up a nice script where you click the part and the ball changes colors I did not force him trust me me I did not kidnap him I'm not the reason he went missing trust me now it's time to give myself 30 minutes to script the game I decided on trying to make an escape room because it sound pretty simple to make at least for my skills I began with building the first room I didn't want to spend much time on the builds cuz I wanted the script and in this room all you're going to do is Click apart and the door will open the script is pretty simple cuz this basically all I've been doing this whole time look at Arnold go and as you see when you click the button the door opens then you can right click to close it if you wonder why I made it right click to close the door because at the time I did not learn if statements I ended up adding small touches to it by making a sound play when you click and the button turns red when the doors open next I decided to work on the second room this room is basically a Obby where you jump into Parts but after a few seconds you can fall through it guys how do I add a debounce time was up but I still wanted to practice my skills so I decided to make a kill part I ly went tool blockx and read the script and then try to memorize it and then kind of copied it but it's okay I kind of learned a little bit I made a script so if you push the part to another part the part the part opens part cuz yeah part opens part yeah I'm not going to lie I don't feel like I'm learning much hopefully the script stay in my brain I don't forget it but it's 1:00 a.m. so I'm going to sleep tell want some love you need some love you need some trust are gone and they BT up I'm the problem but you can't Sol I totally didn't wake up 30 minutes before the 24 hours was up and now I'm panicking and stressing outz I got nothing to show you guys cuz I been doing the same thing all day what am I doing with my life torturing myself that's what I'm doing so I'm going to give myself 20 minutes to make a game disclaimer this part get a little nerdy because I tried to tell you why I did in the script and how I did it first thing I did was create another a button where you click it and it opens the door to do this I get a part I click detector and then check if the player clicks if the player clicks they make the transparency 0.5 and can't Collide off then it waits 2 seconds before closing next I started scripting aart that rly changes colors I used math. random to get a random color out of the RGB so I don't have to put colors that I wanted to change to then I painted the parts around to look a disco party next I made a trap door again but this time I knew how to do a debounce so it looked better very go level one and two is done kill kill part does not work I'm going to quit bro script is way too easy I scripted the leader stats even though I know I'm not going to use it but I did it for the aesthetic yeah I know pretty cool we got boxes only reason I didn't use the leader stat is because I didn't know how to script part so when you touch it it adds one to your leader stat all right the 24 hours is done but in these 24 hours what did I learn I learn learning something new takes time and dedication you can't become a pro overnight but you still can learn a lot in 24 hours but don't expect to be a god once you learn something what do you guys want me to learn next let me know in the comments I you a part say you want me to go say you don't love no one say you don't love no more I'm not ready I'm so sorry know that it's better for you it is not better for me", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:26.184752", "error": ""}
