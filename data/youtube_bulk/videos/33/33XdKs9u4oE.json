"query": "roblox scripting tutorial", "transcript": "there are a lot of scripting tutorials on YouTube however did you know that there's actually something better than video tutorials to learn how to script I'll be revealing what it is in this video so stick till the end real game development is something that requires different skills to create a game you need Builders modelers animators VFX artists someone to do the sounds and also the skill that I picked scripting if you don't know what scripting is put simply scripting is just coding the different systems for your different mechanics of your game basically it makes the game work as you intend it to work and it games that make in reactable and engaging I'll be explaining how I learned how to script and what content or what things I used to learn and it really just boils down to two major things in order for you to understand let me tell you a quick story it's 2020 I'm sitting down in my room using my computer and I've just decided I'm going to learn how to script because I have this game idea I want to make it was like a magico RPG but there's just one problem there's an endless amount of information about this on the internet and YouTube and the first issue that I had and that a lot of developers could very easily have especially if you're new is that you lose a lot of time because you're just trying to pick what content to consume to properly learn so there I was clicking video after video how to make this how to make that tutorials on this tutorials on that and maybe I'm just brain dead but this really made me lose at least one month worth of time I will start a subcription tutorial playlist but that one would be too old so I'd move into another one but the dude on this one just rushes The tutorials this one I can barely understand and speak this other one the D doesn't even speak at all eventually I came across a channel called the death ging while searching for scripting tutorial playlist I tried his series and for me it was the best I could have for at the time I went to take a look at his playlist and I saw that at the time it was pretty much the most complete developed and updated playlist on how to script and so what do I do I just followed his tutorials and replicated absolutely everything on his tutorials now I'm not going to lie I'm not going to sit here and say it was easy it was really taxing and I'd be almost every day almost all day just watching videos and replicating sometimes re-watching and going through the process again to make sure I'd learned things that I felt would be really important and this is how I got my base for scripting I just followed all the Death Kings tutorials on scripting I spent like 4 to 6 months on this but a long time you might say but I think it was worth it to spend that long on that but it doesn't really stop here I got a very good base here but there's another very important piece of content that really solidified my bases and also gave me a little bit more of practical examples for scripting with a the P I'm about to mention I think it would have taken at least four to six more months to exit the baby death stage what I'm talking about is the book by Heath H Haskins the advanced Ro book coding book now almost every person that told to get this book doesn't end up getting this book and they really don't know how much available insight and information they're missing out on as soon as you watch a decent scripting Basics playlist you should get a copy of this book and read it thoroughly honestly scratch another YouTube scripting tutorial Series this book will not only solidify your basis it will also give you practical examples for your scripting which is also extremely important when you're trying to learn and the best part is that he will explain it in a way that you will be able able to easily Implement them I know the book says Advanced but honestly you don't need to be an advanced scripture to find volue in this book I'm telling you read this book man or you're going to miss out on so many valuable insights and information that you'll regret not reading it in the future my only regret with this book is not reading it earlier actually I have a physical copy of the book and I quickly went through it just for the video and since you made it this far into the video I'll let you know this you don't need any playist to learn how to script you just need the book The Advanced Roblox coding book if you're going to take one thing from this video is that you need to get that book as soon as possible ASAP the book covers literally everything and it explains it to you in a very simple way it explains the basics of Roblox Studio coding and also some more advanced stuff that you'll be able to understand if you just go through the book in Order yeah it's that good I do want to clarify I'm not associated at all with this book I wish I was though there's literally no affiliate link no nothing you can search it on Amazon and just get a copy of it I'm just being fully transparent here this book is the only thing you'll really need if you want to learn how to script and so many people sleep on this don't sleep on it get that book if you want to learn how to script that's what I have for today man I really do hope you get that book and don't be like every other person who have
