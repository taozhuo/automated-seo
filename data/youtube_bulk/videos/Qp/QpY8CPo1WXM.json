even begin trust me I've been there but stick around because by the end of this video you'll know exactly how to start scripting on Roblox even if you've never written a single line of code in your life we're going to cover everything from the basics of how to learn scripting to monetizing your skills so let's dive in so I'm smarty RBX and I'm the creator of the number one scripting guide in the world I've taught millions of developers how to script on Roblox and today I'm going to share with you a stepbystep guide on how to get started right now no fluff no wasting time just the real steps you need to take to learn scripting on Roblox so let's get started first things first if you're watching this video and you haven't seen my beginner guide on how to script on Roblox start with that if you watch that video you will learn all the basics you need to get started in Roblox scripting like the syntax the basic concepts and how to start piecing those skills together into full scripts you can open the video in the top right hand corner in a new tab and start learning but don't just watch the video Start scripting now follow along and you'll see how quickly you'll improve as a scripter so the second second tip is to stop focusing on making games when you start if you're watching this you probably want to make Roblox games you want to make entire games on the platform and that's great but if you've just started the first thing you should do is simply replicate simple features you like from your favorite games on Roblox you could go into pet simulator 99 and you could look at the button animations or the way that they have the UI up when you get near the eggs to buy them if you use your scripting skills to recreate these simple systems it's one of the best ways to learn more about scripting and develop your skills and it doesn't need to be perfect it just needs to be good practice this approach is a way to make scripting less intimidating and way more fun instead of making a big game first start simple make pieces of games and then once you do this enough you'll realize that you now have the skill to make entire games but right now start simple and use this approach to improve your skills gradually tip three be okay with looking things up when I started as a scriptor in 2021 I remember that I used to worry about looking things up all the time I used to think that I wasn't as good of a scripter if I had to look things up but as I went on in scripting I began to notice that every scriptor looks things up Pro scriptors still still look things up as they code nobody knows everything I don't know everything Preston from big games doesn't know everything and hm doesn't know everything either so if you're watching this understand that it is okay to look things up as you script and not just okay but it's a good thing when you look at the Roblox documentation when you use AI as a resource when you even ask a friend or someone in smarty devs join our Discord below by the way how to script something you aren't less of a script you're becoming a better scriptor because you are learning use your resources all you can and don't rely on things too much the difference between a noob scriptor who doesn't know what he's doing and a PR scriptor is not that the noob uses resources but the proscriptor doesn't no it's that the proscriptor also goes the extra mile to understand the resources and understand how the code works at a deeper level many developers they make the mistake of watching these videos on how to make a tycoon and then they just copy the code and don't think about how it works and don't try to figure out how everything works together in the script it's not surprising that these developers don't learn anything that's the real mistake so use your resources but the key is to make sure that you understand the code as well and if you do that you'll always be on the right track now the next point I'm about to tell you is very Rel ated it's to use AI as a tool not a replacement leverage AI to improve your scripting but don't rely on it use it to suggest improvements debug and optimize and also learn new things about scripting but remember AI is not your replacement it's your assistant you are the one creating not the AI it's okay to use AI it's a great resource whether you use chat GPT or the RO blocks AI that they have on the create page it's good to use your resources including AI but not to rely on it too much remember how I just told you the key is to use your resources but also make sure that you understand how the code works as well when you use AI it's the same thing ask it questions but also make sure that you look at what the AI is doing you could even ask it why it's making its certain decisions why did you use this code oh why did you use this instead of this why do you use a function here instead of just writing the code without a function these are the questions that will help you to improve as a scripter rather than using AI as a crutch now tip five if you're watching this far I'll bet you are very serious about taking your skills to the next level on Roblox and if that's
