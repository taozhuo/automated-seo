games on the Roblox platform he reads up on the Roblox documentation to learn how to make a game until he hits a roadblock trying to figure out what the heck a script is and how a game comes together and as a result of that he quits on day one and probably doesn't have a computer anymore after destroying it out of frustration and now he can't pursue making the games he's always wanted to make oh Newbert becoming a Roblox game developer doesn't happen overnight you'll especially have to put in the time put in the effort and face the struggles headon when you don't understand a concept especially in the world of scripting and programming in the beginning it can be very difficult and demotivating to continuously learn how to become a better Roblox scriptor when you keep getting faced with error messages and unintended effects in your game it's a real struggle most beginners face when learning how to script on Roblox which is why I want to make this playlist to help you reach your goals of making the games that you want to create on Roblox my name is brev and I will be teaching you everything you need to know to become a great Roblox scriptor I've been scripting on Roblox for about 7 to8 years and during this time I've made countless projects that just weren't successful but one thing that kept me going throughout all these years was the desire to learn more and actually have an interest in the things I was learning even if I fa challenges when learning new things especially during times when I was demotivated and I hope you can adopt the secret strategy to go through this journey of becoming a Roblox game developer as of recording this video I have have two playlists ready for you to watch once you finish this beginner guide the advanced scripting tutorial guide and the GUI tutorial guide it's quite a scary journey to go through all these episodes considering how many there are now but like I mentioned becoming a Roblox game developer isn't easy and so I would like to make the journey easier for you by having everything you need to know in these playlists ranging from the very Basics to the advanced concepts and accelerate you to become a pro Roblox scriptor and game developer in 2024 and with that being said let's now go ahead and start making games on Roblox all right so what you see here is the homepage of the software called Roblox studio now this is the software we're going to be using to create our Roblox games so that we can upload them to the Roblox website and so players can actually play your game that's uploaded to Roblox I'll leave a link to this in the description if you want to download Roblox studio so that you can log in with your account and then you can be greeted with this same exact home screen just like you're seeing in this video now before we do anything I encourage you to basically follow exactly what I do step by step so that you can kind of get a feel for how to use Roblox studio and you're experiencing what I'm teaching you while you follow through with these videos because just watching me go through these tutorial videos isn't going to be enough to help you learn so that's why I encourage you to literally do exactly what I do as you watch these videos to follow along and learn from doing it yourself as well so now that we've gotten that out of the way once we are here inside of this home screen uh Roblox has a bunch of templates that we can choose from as a starter place to start making our Roblox games for the purpose of this tutorial guide we're going to use this Bas plate template right here I'm just going to click on this and then what's going to happen is Roblox is going to load in this template that we just selected and now we are thrown into this world that we can now mess around with to create our Roblox game and upload it onto the platform now there are a couple of things here that I want to introduce to you so that you get a feel for how Roblox Studio works because that's our goal for this first episode it's to familiarize ourselves with using Roblox studio and some of the things that they have to offer and the first thing I want to show you is being able to navigate around this 3D world that you see right here that represents our Roblox game so I want you to imagine you're playing Roblox on PC the controls You' probably use are W and for the keys and also the mouse as well so it kind of works the same way here as well so if we hold W that's going to move our camera forward if we hold s that's going to move our camera backwards if we hold a that's going to go left and then D that's going to go right and if we want to move the camera specifically then what we can do is hold the right Mouse button and then drag our Mouse around the world so that we can change our camera to face a certain direction and we can combine these movements together so that we're able to move around Studio as we so desire to uh some other things we can do is hold Q to make our uh camera go down and then hold e to make our camera go up and we can even use the scrolling wheel to scroll outward and also scroll inward as well so these are some basic movement controls that I will um introduce to you for this episode and maybe go through some more later down the line but that's like the basics of being able to move around inside of Roblox studio so now there are some some windows that I want to show you that are going to be very important for the entirety of this tutorial guide the first one is this Roblox Studio ribbon up here that basically shows all of the resources and services that they have provided to us so that we can use them for our Roblox game so right now we're in the home category so if we select a different tab like model then it's going to show us a bunch of different things here that we can use and if we go to Avatar uh it's going to show some different stuff test view plugins and all these other sorts of things that are going to be very helpful for us now another window that's extremely important to understand is What's called the Explorer as you can see right here on the right side you can see that there's all of these different folders inside of here with different names and I'm going to try and give a brief explanation as to what this all means well to basically summarize what the Explorer is it's basically a directory full of folders that have its own specific purposes where you combine all of them together to make up one Roblox game so every single Roblox game you can think of basically has this structure right here with all of these different folders with different purposes that you will need to learn how to use as a Roblox game developer so one of the ones uh as an example is called workspace uh workspace is what basically shows us the entire 3D World and this is how we're able to render things inside of this game screen it's when we put objects inside of this workspace folder now if we were to open up this workspace folder so if we click on this Arrow that's um to the left of it then we can see that there's actually stuff contained within this workspace folder so we have the camera terrain spawn location base plate and things like that and if we open these up we can see that there's other stuff in here contained within the thing that's within the workspace so you can kind of see that there's this hierarchy structure going on uh with this workspace and it's very important to understand the structure when you're working with finding stuff within your game and so it's a really good practice to understand how this structure works now if I were to select one of these objects like let's say the workspace uh we can see that down here uh it showed a bunch of things in this uh other window called properties now this is the next window that is going to be extremely important to understand so basically what this window does is it shows all of the the properties the attributes the settings or configurations whatever you want to describe it as uh for the objects that we selected so what we selected is this workspace object and there's all these properties here um that are associated with that object that we can actually change ourselves um and if we select a different objects like let's say the spawn location it's going to show different properties for this spawn location object and we can actually change it and see the change in real time inside of our game so if we were to let's say change um the color let's say so if I click on the color then it's going to show us this color wheel right here that we can just pick whichever color we want so if I were to let's say pick this color and I hit okay then it's going to change the color in real time and we can actually see this change inside of Roblox studio so that's kind of a cool thing to know about uh when it comes to understanding the properties window and also the Explorer window and how both of them work together to basically um have stuff inside of our workspace and now the next thing I want to demonstrate is being able to add parts inside of the game so I'm actually going to deselect the spawn location by simply selecting anywhere inside of this world uh just like that and what I'm going to do is go on the top ribbon and click on this part button that's inside of the insert category so I'm going to click this and as you can see Roblox has inserted a part for us to use and what I can do is take this part hold left click and drag it wherever I want to put it inside of the workspace now there are other tools that I want to introduce to you that you might find extremely helpful so we're able to select this and move it around and this is what's called the select tool as you can see up here um on the screen the next tool is called move so if we select this then we can see these arrows that are surrounding this part so if we hold this blue arrow and then move it this way then it's going to move the part in this specific Direction and we can do the same thing for the red arrow and we can do the same thing for the Green Arrow as well another thing we can do is change the size of this part by clicking on this scale tool so if we scale this part this way then it's going to move it in this direction and the last tool is the rotate tool so if we select this then we can see that this basically resembles a bunch of circles we select whichever Circle we want and then we move it in that direction specifically so I'm kind of just moving this part around a little bit and that is basically how you use the rotate part now once again I want to deselect this so I'm just going to click elsewhere like this and now we have a part that basically just does absolutely nothing but uh what I wanted to get out here was uh getting the feel and practice for moving around Roblox studio and also adding Parts into the game so that's basically the introduction to using Roblox studio now at the end of every single video for this playlist what I want to do is give you a learning objective or a challenge um to assess what you learned inside of each video now for this learning objective what I want you to do is basically just continue to experiment with Roblox Studio either e by moving around inside of the workspace or by adding more parts like this so I'm actually going to go up here and I'm going to insert another part and we can do whatever we want with it by I don't know changing the brick color changing the size if we select the scale tool just like this and you know things like that you can even navigate through more settings over here and that's another great way of familiarizing yourself with Roblox studio and once you are done with this learning objective I want you to go down to the comments of this video and describe what you did for for this learning objective so that other people who watch this tutorial can see what other people have been doing and I think it would just be a really great way to show what everybody else is doing for these challenges now before we end off this video there's one final thing I forgot to mention and that is the importance of saving your work so that you don't lose your progress so what we can do is go on the top left here in file and we're going to click save to file as and it's going to show up our file directory right here and you can just pick wherever you want to save this Roblox Studio place in so I'm just going to pick this place you can even rename it to whatever you want to I'm just going to say beginner scripting guide to 2024 just like that and I'm going to hit enter and there we go now our place is saved and I encourage you to save your game uh very frequently so that you don't lose progress as you go through this tutorial guide so that's pretty much going to be it for this episode and I will see you in the next episode take care", "scraped_at": "2026-01-08T15:05:08.451976", "error": ""}
