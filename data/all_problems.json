I have this issue, where my animations break on the character after changing the mesh id. \n In my game, your character is a duck and players can use different skins (these different skins have different mesh ids, texture ids, mesh-part colors, mesh-part materials, etc.). All in game animations work, its just the hat that stops following. \n A snippet of how I change their avatars (via server): \n         image  374\u00d7446 21.7 KB         \n  \n--[[ \nTo be clear: \n- AS = AssetService (Used to load the new meshpart, since MeshId is read only)\n- part is the part inside the character that the player chose to equip (its the same model, same structure) [See attachement 2 for structure of avatar] \n\n- itemInChar is the part inside the player character\n- What happens is: I assign to the part that is inside the **player.Character.MeshPart (itemInChar)** the MeshId and TextureID property of the MeshPart (part) that player wants to equip\n]]\n\nlocal meshId = part.MeshId\n\n\tlocal S,F = pcall(function()\n\t\tlocal meshPart = AS:CreateMeshPartAsync(meshId)\n\t\titemInChar:ApplyMesh(meshPart)\n\t\titemInChar.TextureID = part.TextureID\n\t\tmeshPart:Destroy()\n        end)\n\n  \n The custom character rig (a Duck) uses Motor6Ds for animation. I want to dynamically change the \u201cHat\u201d accessory by updating its  MeshId  and  TextureId  via a script when the player equips a new skin. The Hat should continue to animate (bob/tilt) along with the head/beak just like the default hat does. \n   What is the issue? \n The default hat animates perfectly (Screenshot 1). However, as soon as my script changes the  MeshId  of the Hat part (using  ApplyMesh  or manual property assignment),  the Hat stops animating . (Screenshot 3, the one below) \n         image  778\u00d7800 45.6 KB         \n It seems like the AnimationTrack no longer \u201crecognizes\u201d the part once the MeshId changes, causing the Hat to freeze in place relative to the RootPart, even though it is still named \u201cHa",

I have tried to do tweening to make it so that the cross hair will contract when a player holds down the right mouse button, then expand when they release it, however its really buggy. Right now if i make the tween go any slower than 0.1 seconds, the cross hair just disappears when the player holds down rmb, then reappears when the tween is finished, and the same happens when rmb is released. At 0.1 seconds, the tween is non-existent - the size just changes, with pretty much no actual \u201ccontraction\u201d movement like a tween should be - it basically looks as if i just ran gui.Size = Udim2.new(newsize) rather than did gui:TweenSize().

Currently in one of my games I have several SpawnLocations used to change a player\u2019s team. It was using the default ROBLOX functionality, but I did change end up scripting them manually in an attempt to address this issue. \n  The Problem: When players touch any unanchored parts (particularly tools), the game will randomly act as if the player touched the last SpawnLocation interacted with regardless of the part or distance from the SpawnLocation.  \n I cannot recreate this consistently. It seems to happen completely randomly, but more than often enough to disrupt gameplay significantly. This causes the player to change teams to the team of the last SpawnLocation touched. \n When I changed it to a script which detects touch instead of using ROBLOX\u2019s built-in team change on touch, the issue persisted. Notably, it prints that the part interacted with is the player\u2019s HumanoidRootPart, regardless of what part they had touched to trigger the long distance team change. I kept track of the HumanoidRootPart\u2019s position, and it is unchanged in this interaction, it just somehow assumes the player touched the SpawnLocation. This is especially weird because normally it is one of the player\u2019s legs which touch a SpawnLocation first. \n Anyone encounter this before? I don\u2019t want to have to check the player\u2019s distance from the SpawnLocation on interaction if I can avoid it. ",

I have tried to do tweening to make it so that the cross hair will contract when a player holds down the right mouse button, then expand when they release it, however its really buggy. Right now if i make the tween go any slower than 0.1 seconds, the cross hair just disappears when the player holds down rmb, then reappears when the tween is finished, and the same happens when rmb is released. At 0.1 seconds, the tween is non-existent - the size just changes, with pretty much no actual \u201ccontraction\u201d movement like a tween should be - it basically looks as if i just ran gui.Size = Udim2.new(newsize) rather than did gui:TweenSize(). So, obviously gui doesnt have a CFrame feature for learping, however is there something equivalent or similar I can do to make the crosshair UI expand and contract smoothly, similar to how the gun viewmodel moves smoothly between the ADS and normal position when RMB is pressed/released? \n  -- Variables \nlocal player = game.Players.LocalPlayer\nlocal character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()\n\nlocal cam = workspace.CurrentCamera\n\nlocal aimCFrame = CFrame.new()\nlocal isAiming = false\n\nlocal currentSwayAmount = 0\nlocal swayAmount = -0.2\nlocal aimSwayAmount = 0.3\nlocal swayCFrame = CFrame.new()\nlocal lastCameraCFrame = CFrame.new()\n\nlocal uis = game:GetService(\"UserInputService\")\nuis.MouseIconEnabled = false\n\nlocal crossHare = player.PlayerGui.CustomMouse.ImageLabel \n\nlocal runService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\nlocal framework = {\n\tinventory = {\n\t\t\"Pistol\";\n\t\t\"Knife\";\n\t\t\"AppleLauncher\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tmodule = nil;\n\tviewmodel = nil;\n\tcurrentSlot = 1; \n}\n\nfunction loadSlot(ite",

But the video shows that doesn\u2019t happen, which is why I\u2019m confused. \n I\u2019m not setting the rotation directly using a Vector3 value, as I need to use CFrames to rotate models and cameras.

These work perfectly fine. \n The game in question, however, is a transit game (Potato City Subway), and we are giving users access to route bullets for better roleplay and interactivity. \n  \n   example above \n The issue is, this flies entirely over roblox\u2019s filter, and inputting swears does not provoke the chat filter at all. We want to give a way for the chat filter to actually recognize these to check for swears and banned words, but we aren\u2019t sure how. \n It seems nobody else has encountered such a problem, and because we want a vast variety of emojis, a solution has been hard to come by. \n Any help would be greatly appreciated with this problem.

Just not sure what exactly I\u2019m trying to optimize at this point. \n While my projects are becoming larger iin size, I\u2019m experiencing slowdowns in the regions with loops, event listeners, or many service calls. Though I have some tips in my bag, I\u2019m still not aware of how to implement them in a practical project. \n I\u2019ve tried a few common optimization techniques like caching services to avoid repeated calls, and reducing the number of  FindFirstChild  checks inside loops. I\u2019ve also been more mindful about when to use  wait()  in loops. But I feel like I could be doing more to improve the overall performance. \n Example: \n  local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\nlocal localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer\n\nfor _, player in ipairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do\n    if player == localPlayer then\n        -- idk do something specific\n    end\nend\n  \n Any tips and tricks would be really helpful :} ",

My original solution was to do it through the client, which handles creating the hitbox, target detection, and everything that doesn\u2019t include changing values like damage.

I\u2019ve found myself in a situation where I need an alternative to  string.split() , not only do I need multiple separators, I want each separator to have variable lengths and symbols \n I\u2019m not asking for a script, I\u2019m pretty sure I could write one up that just bruteforces string.find as it collects each occurrence, but I was wondering if this has already been done in a cleaner, more efficient way \n EDIT: Another detail that drastically complicates this issue: I\u2019d like the separator to be kept in the string, not deleted like what string.split does \n Any help is appreciated!

I\u2019d go as far as to say it is a showcase game attempting to house a roleplay game \n          image-37  1920\u00d7884 175 KB         \n That obviously poses a lot of issues from an optimization front, aside from the clear issues of some devices being alienated from gameplay - we really want to try to find a way to balance a stunning artistic experience, with an optimized game that is playable on all devices \n \n Here are some steps we have taken, that have obviously helped, but are not enough right now: \n \n \n VisTools is being used for a very stringent LOD system. The amount of buildings is massive, so the  entire  building is being turned into a singular block LOD as soon as you get out of direct eyeshot of it. I believe this is set to around 120 studs before it turns \n \n \n Smaller details such as mailboxes, lamp posts, small furniture, flower pots etc are all set to detail_tiny using VisTools at radius of 45 and are removed from the workspace at that radius \n \n \n Streaming is on, with a min radius of 1024. I wanted to keep this a lot smaller, but this was not possible - I believe due to the amount of items in the workspace. As soon as a new chunk renders, with a smaller radius it just completely freeze frames \n \n \n StreamingMesh has not really been played around with at all, everything is currently set to default \n \n \n Almost all interior lights and exterior lights are radius based, and are put into ReplicatedStorage by default \u2013 only being turned \u201con\u201d with a scripted light switch. The only outstanding lights are street lights at night (scripted) \n \n \n Optimizations hav",

      "content": " I am making my own character movement system, and I use  VectorForce  to apply force to the character. \nWhen the character has lower velocities, like being under 16 studs/second, it moves smoothly. \nBut once the velocity gets higher and reaches about 15, the character starts to vibrate/jitter up and down. \nI\u2019ve found out this happens because while moving the bottom part is in contact with the ground, which causes it to tilt slightly forward, and when that happens, its position gets slightly up on the Y axis, and to remove the tilting, I use  AlignOrientation  constraint with rigidity enabled. \nThe problem with this approach is that  AlignOrientation  with rigidity enabled wont actually lock the rotation of the character but applies force in such a way that the object\u2019s orientation matches the target orientation. \n So this is what is happening, the contact with the ground slightly tilts the character forward causing its position to get incremented slightly upwards. Then the align orientation constraint makes its rotation back to by applying torque force. \nBut as the position of the cylinder was incremented previously, the cylinder is slightly above the ground in the next frame, and in the next next frame it comes down, and this process repeats. \n Isnt there another approach to this? Like in unity we can just tell the game engine to just lock the rotation of an object on a certain axis. \n This is what i\u2019ve tried so far: \n \n Setting the density of the character very high (increases mass) \n Setting the friction of the character and baseplate to 0 \n Applying the force on the bottom of the character \n Forcing the CFrame of the character to have 0 rotation in both the  PreSimulation  and  Heartbeat  (After simulation of the frame is completed) events. \n \n All these methods have reduced the jittering by a lot but not completely. \nHere\u2019s the video, in the last part i show what happens when I disable  AlignOrientation  and as you can see it tilts in the direction of movement",

Is 60 fps too fast? I appreciate all the help I can get. ",

Usually it works perfectly, but when I try to turn on streaming enabled, the icons/the topbargui itself disappear entirely from my topbar.

It is simply just this GUI that is disappearing from streaming enabled. \n I have tried: \n \n Moving my script from starterplayerscripts to startergui aswell as serverscriptservice (I found it works best normally in starterplayerscripts, despite how odd the placement is) \n Waiting for Topbar to exist in PlayerGui fully \n Ensured TopbarPlus reattaches icons with Icon.setTopbarEnabled(true) \n All icon creation were put in a function and called after Topbar is ready \n Removed SetCoreGuiEnabled(All) function \n etc etc etc. \n \n Im starting to believe that it is not anything wrong with the script itself afterall, but rather something else? \n I\u2019ve gotten to a point in my game where it is becoming rather large with a lot of assets, and every update deals with optimization as I do not want the game to be unplayable for lower ended devices. I believe streaming enabled is the key to that fix without having to remove a large portion of the map, but I cannot do that until my topbar works seamlessly with streaming enabled on as it does when it is off.

I have tried to do tweening to make it so that the cross hair will contract when a player holds down the right mouse button, then expand when they release it, however its really buggy. Right now if i make the tween go any slower than 0.1 seconds, the cross hair just disappears when the player holds down rmb, then reappears when the tween is finished, and the same happens when rmb is released. At 0.1 seconds, the tween is non-existent - the size just changes, with pretty much no actual \u201ccontraction\u201d movement like a tween should be - it basically looks as if i just ran gui.Size = Udim2.new(newsize) rather than did gui:TweenSize(). So, obviously gui doesnt have a CFrame feature for learping, however is there something equivalent or similar I can do to make the crosshair UI expand and contract smoothly, similar to how the gun viewmodel moves smoothly between the ADS and normal position when RMB is pressed/released? \n  -- Variables \nlocal player = game.Players.LocalPlayer\nlocal character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()\n\nlocal cam = workspace.CurrentCamera\n\nlocal aimCFrame = CFrame.new()\nlocal isAiming = false\n\nlocal currentSwayAmount = 0\nlocal swayAmount = -0.2\nlocal aimSwayAmount = 0.3\nlocal swayCFrame = CFrame.new()\nlocal lastCameraCFrame = CFrame.new()\n\nlocal uis = game:GetService(\"UserInputService\")\nuis.MouseIconEnabled = false\n\nlocal crossHare = player.PlayerGui.CustomMouse.ImageLabel \n\nlocal runService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\nlocal framework = {\n\tinventory = {\n\t\t\"Pistol\";\n\t\t\"Knife\";\n\t\t\"AppleLauncher\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tmodule = nil;\n\tviewmodel = nil;\n\tcurrentSlot = 1; \n}\n\nfunction loadSlot(ite",

When u apply this logic at the moment server receives first request it calculates the latency and rewinds the time but there is no fast forward, simulation of server and shooters client never get synced its reason of the problem on that schema \n This is whats my solution to it: \n         image  858\u00d7419 18.9 KB         \nThe server processes the  all of snapshots got affected by latency  at the frame receives packet and i guess this would be expensive for server. \n So why i created this post; i inspired that fast forward logic just by one not solved unity forum post i dont even know this logic exist in real games applying lag compensation for projectiles like overwatch and etc. \n So whats correct way to implementation of rewind lag compensation for projectiles?

      "content": " Hi all, \n I was hoping someone in this forum could help me with a bizzare issue I am facing. Currently in one of my games I have several SpawnLocations used to change a player\u2019s team. It was using the default ROBLOX functionality, but I did change end up scripting them manually in an attempt to address this issue. \n  The Problem: When players touch any unanchored parts (particularly tools), the game will randomly act as if the player touched the last SpawnLocation interacted with regardless of the part or distance from the SpawnLocation.  \n I cannot recreate this consistently. It seems to happen completely randomly, but more than often enough to disrupt gameplay significantly. This causes the player to change teams to the team of the last SpawnLocation touched. \n When I changed it to a script which detects touch instead of using ROBLOX\u2019s built-in team change on touch, the issue persisted. Notably, it prints that the part interacted with is the player\u2019s HumanoidRootPart, regardless of what part they had touched to trigger the long distance team change. I kept track of the HumanoidRootPart\u2019s position, and it is unchanged in this interaction, it just somehow assumes the player touched the SpawnLocation. This is especially weird because normally it is one of the player\u2019s legs which touch a SpawnLocation first. \n Anyone encounter this before? I don\u2019t want to have to check the player\u2019s distance from the SpawnLocation on interaction if I can avoid it. ",

Though I have some tips in my bag, I\u2019m still not aware of how to implement them in a practical project. \n I\u2019ve tried a few common optimization techniques like caching services to avoid repeated calls, and reducing the number of  FindFirstChild  checks inside loops. I\u2019ve also been more mindful about when to use  wait()  in loops. But I feel like I could be doing more to improve the overall performance. \n Example: \n  local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\nlocal localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer\n\nfor _, player in ipairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do\n    if player == localPlayer then\n        -- idk do something specific\n    end\nend\n  \n Any tips and tricks would be really helpful :} ",

I want it so that when you click anywhere but the pop up, the pop up automatically closes. And also prevent the buttons in the background from being pressed. \n \n  What is the issue?  Include screenshots / videos if possible! \n \n I had an idea of having a text button that\u2019s the size of the entire screen to detect all button presses not inside the frame. Although this does prevent the buttons in the background from being pressed, pressing the frame closes it, because the button detects the click through the frame. \n \n  What solutions have you tried so far?  Did you look for solutions on the Creator Hub? \n \n I tried this orientation: \n  \nAnd I messed with the Z index too \n This orientation: (the button\u2019s size here is {10,0},{10,0} \n  \n And this orientation: \n  \n After that, you should include more details if you have any. Try to make your topic as descriptive as possible, so that it\u2019s easier for people to help you! \n In all three cases, you can still click through/past the frame. I need it so that when you click the frame, nothing happens. Shall I make the frame a button as well, and disable the auto button color? In my main game, the frame is actually a scrolling frame, so I can\u2019t do that. So just put a button behind the scrolling frame to absorb the clicks from the  BackgroundClickDetectorTextButton ? \n  -- This is an example Lua code block\n  \n Please do not ask people to write entire scripts or design entire systems for you.

I am currently working on a driving game and I am attempting to establish myself as a professional developer with intent of getting my game to the front page one day. \n I currently use the plugin  Archimedes Two   to curve my roads. However, it looks like this plugin isn\u2019t ideal for making realistic roads because the curves are created relative to the source model/part, which means they are always on a local axis. This presents a huge problem when I make a winding road that curves on two axes (for example, Y and Z), as a prominent horizontal tilt becomes noticeable as I create more segments. This isn\u2019t really a glitch, but a result of logical mathematical outcomes due to the way the plugin is scripted. In some circumstances this is fine and ideal (and I\u2019d say in most cases it is) but in my case, where I\u2019m trying to create roads, it\u2019s a giant issue. \n Unfortunately, the plugin doesn\u2019t seem to have an option to create curves relative to the world axis (as if you were manually making curves by duplicating parts) instead of the source model/part\u2019s orientation, so I have no idea what to do. I\u2019ve been searching for alternative ways to create roads to no avail. \n Does anyone know if there is any other plugin that I can use to supplement what I\u2019m currently using, but instead of curving on a local axis it does it on the world axis? Is it possible to modify the plugin to use the world axis, and if so, how could this be done? This is really stressing me out, so I appreciate all help! ",

My original solution was to do it through the client, which handles creating the hitbox, target detection, and everything that doesn\u2019t include changing values like damage.

I have been looking at alternatives, maybe plugins, that I achieve the same package management without the use of VSC for roblox coding. I have attempted to install  RoStrap  and could NOT get it to properly run or work with its required permissions. \n  Are there better alternatives or does anyone have an idea where I could find something that could properly update modules that I may use in projects?  \n i am unsure if this question belongs in Scripting Support, but it involves the management of modulescripts in ReplicatedStorage.

Everything works perfectly overall, but I can\u2019t seem to find a solution to a small delay that occurs when the attacked player is knocked back. \n   \n     \n The attacked player gets hit and launched smoothly as intended, but the attacker sees a delayed version of this knockback. I understand this happens because the server is handling the physics, and I know it can be configured using NetworkOwnership. However, I haven\u2019t been able to find the exact or similar method used by smooth combat games like  The Strongest Battlegrounds  to achieve responsive knockback with good performance on both clients. \nAny help is appreciated!!

Then the align orientation constraint makes its rotation back to by applying torque force. \nBut as the position of the cylinder was incremented previously, the cylinder is slightly above the ground in the next frame, and in the next next frame it comes down, and this process repeats. \n Isnt there another approach to this? Like in unity we can just tell the game engine to just lock the rotation of an object on a certain axis. \n This is what i\u2019ve tried so far: \n \n Setting the density of the character very high (increases mass) \n Setting the friction of the character and baseplate to 0 \n Applying the force on the bottom of the character \n Forcing the CFrame of the character to have 0 rotation in both the  PreSimulation  and  Heartbeat  (After simulation of the frame is completed) events. \n \n All these methods have reduced the jittering by a lot but not completely. \nHere\u2019s the video, in the last part i show what happens when I disable  AlignOrientation  and as you can see it tilts in the direction of movement",

Sometimes it works perfectly for a whole session. Other times, I stop the game in Studio, hit Play again, and the Raycast returns  nil  continuously, even when my mouse is directly over the object. \n \n It seems like a race condition or an initialization issue, but  WaitForChild  is used for the instances.

Today in my friend\u2019s game with an A-Chassis vehicle in it, an exploiter used it to play sounds like loud beeping, bass boosted audio and a loud audio saying \u201cThis game has been exploited\u201d. Sounds so short that they could have easily bypassed the Roblox 6 second audio limit \n Please can someone develop a patch or even a way to figure out who could be playing these sounds to be able to at least ban them asap! Because it\u2019s been so long and I\u2019ve been looking on the devforum and other places to try and find someone who could have patched it but nobody has yet (to my knowledge). \n Thank you! ",

I decided to fix this and make a new communication system: \n Client is doing the first raycast, and if it\u2019s successful, it waits raycast1.Distance/bulletSpeed and fires another raycast that finally shows a hitmarker, makes bullet hole and sends info (position and direction) to server, where it fires ANOTHER raycast and only then it deals damage or creates an explosion.

That\u2019s very annoying, because 80% of all bullets just don\u2019t deal any damage, but there\u2019s a hitmarker and blood particles. I may perform raycasting from a server and then get the result on client and do hitmarker or bullet hole, but the client will get too much delayed information (Very critical to ingame experience). \n  Is there a way to make such system that will be protected from exploiters, but also register bullets normally?  \n  ",

When u apply this logic at the moment server receives first request it calculates the latency and rewinds the time but there is no fast forward, simulation of server and shooters client never get synced its reason of the problem on that schema \n This is whats my solution to it: \n         image  858\u00d7419 18.9 KB         \nThe server processes the  all of snapshots got affected by latency  at the frame receives packet and i guess this would be expensive for server. \n So why i created this post; i inspired that fast forward logic just by one not solved unity forum post i dont even know this logic exist in real games applying lag compensation for projectiles like overwatch and etc. \n So whats correct way to implementation of rewind lag compensation for projectiles?

A specific character has a move that lets him grab a survivor, holding him in place via network ownership and a bodymover (no weld). They automatically drop the survivor when they get stunned during this move. \n For some reason, there is a very rare chance that the killer gets sent to the void immediately upon getting stunned out of their grab. I assume this is some sort of roblox physics engine bug with the very high values set to the bodyvelocities maxforce, but are there any work-arounds to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen? It\u2019s rare but its game ruining for players when it does happen. ",

I\u2019m trying to do this with a normal humanoid R15 rig so it would likely be a little simpler than using a custom model. \n I\u2019ve tried attaching a part at my desired position to the player with a WeldConstraint and then having the rig use Humanoid:MoveTo(ThePartInQuestion) but the rig tends to lag behind towards that point rather than snapping around like Divine Dog and Rika are in JJS. Anyone have any clues or tips on how to accomplish this effect/what parts of the documentation to look at? \n My first inclination is towards some CFrame magic but I\u2019ve also tested linking a constant CFrame refresh to RunService.Heartbeat but I imagine that will be laggy for the game I\u2019m gonna use this in. Currently the movement code is in a server script to make sure movement is shown on all clients and there\u2019s no weird desync.

The user experience becomes significantly worse on anything higher than ~100ms of ping on my side due to input latency. \n Now for most of these games, I have been researching on how they have their game structured and how it\u2019s been designed and they seem to be running their ability logic on the server \u2013 or either on the client, after sending a request to the server and waiting for approval to run it after (which doubles in latency due to the packet having to travel two times just to run the logic). This just doesn\u2019t play well on high ping, but compensates for being fair and mostly cheat-proof, and also look the same to both clients when simulating physics (because the server is the source of truth and also doing the heavy work). \n I have been leaning towards a combat system with a sort of server authoritative architecture for better responsiveness, but came across a ton of downsides, one of which is how physics look like to the user. For context, here is a pseudocode I came up with that represents the system I have: \n \n Every ability will split into two modules: the server side, and client side. \n The client side ability code runs  immediately  upon input after checking if it can be activated with some client sanity checks, for responsiveness. This is assuming that the server agrees with the client\u2019s decision. \n When the client side ability code runs, it sends a remote signal to the server for validation, and run server ability code. Two things can happen here:\n \n The server agrees with the client, and nothing happens. \n The server disagrees with the client, and send back a remote signal to that client and rollback to their previous state \n \n \n Every ability can decide their own cooldowns on both client and servers. This makes adding abilities with special inputs easier. \n An ability ending means that",

But what I don\u2019t know is HOW to implement it.  \nI am aware that the way DTI made their game isn\u2019t a public information, but I hope that there\u2019s people who are more experienced than me and can help me give ideas for solutions.

(Also curious if the process is any different if the clothes have bones with physics, eg. long sleeves) \n2 - Should clothes be counted as an accessory? If so, then that means they need attachments, right? \n3 - Would this work if I have a single-mesh body and a non-R15 rig? Or would it be better to have the custom R15 package? (The body making and importing is a whole another story that I have a lot of questions about, but this is about everything I wanna find out about yet) \n4 - Another thing I noticed is that some items replace the body parts, how is that possible? Is the body part it replaces invisible and does the item have its own \u201cskin\u201d parts that displays on top of that? \n5 - I\u2019m also kind of curious about equipping the clothes to the body and how to script a button to do that (not a touch brick). \n6 - Also curious about assigning animations/poses to items. Mainly because I wanted to make a separate pose for feet so that the pose alters between heels and flat shoes or bare feet without replacing the feet entirely. Would it cause a lot of problems for the animations (Even if I make other non-shoes animations/poses without the feet key frames)? \n This is my first post so I apologize if this i",

However, it derails on banking. \n We have normal HingeConstraints / BallSocket, which became too wobbly or still derail. \n Not to mention, we look through the creator hub, old train tutorials, devforum threads. Most are pre-2023 and still use the old 4-hinge method that breads on banking. \n We know the TrackAnchor with the UniversalConstraint method that supposed to fix this (which every big subway group uses it now), but we can\u2019t figure out the exact, simple setup that actually works completely. \n If anyone would drop a minimal open .rbxm (or step-by-step with pictures) of a working front and rear bogie using the aforementioned TrackAnchor and the UniversalConstraint that survives heavy banking, that would be great. \n It would save us (and probably half the train community) weeks of pain and frustration. \n Post-editing note: If anyone has any knowledge about tilted rails, particularly in relation to superelevation, I would deeply appreciate your help. It would mean a lot to me to have that information. Thank you so much! ",

Unfortunately, every post I\u2019ve found about such are closed and simply demos, and despite multiple people having made fully fleshed-out systems that even come packed with terrain destruction and generation, none of them were open source or even remotely used other than for demos. \n After scouring the toolbox multiple times I couldn\u2019t find any plugins that matched the use case, and the same goes for the devforum.

The system has two main features: \n \n  Hover effect:  When the mouse is over the paper, a  SelectionBox  should become visible (handled in  RenderStepped ). \n  Click interaction:  When clicking the paper, it tweens to the camera (handled in  InputBegan ). \n \n  The Problem:  The Raycasting logic is erratic. \n \n  InputBegan (Click):  Works 99% of the time. \n  RenderStepped (Hover):  It is extremely inconsistent. Sometimes it works perfectly for a whole session. Other times, I stop the game in Studio, hit Play again, and the Raycast returns  nil  continuously, even when my mouse is directly over the object. \n \n It seems like a race condition or an initialization issue, but  WaitForChild  is used for the instances. It\u2019s weird that the exact same Raycast function works for clicks but fails for the hover loop in the same session. \n  The Setup:  \n \n I am using  RaycastParams  with  FilterType.Include . \n The target consists of a specific  Paper  part, a  Hitbox  part, and several  CheckMark  parts (tagged via CollectionService). \n \n  The Code:  \n  --!strict\n-- Simplified version of the handler\n\nlocal ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService(\"ReplicatedStorage\")\nlocal RunService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\nlocal UserInputService = game:GetService(\"UserInputService\")\nlocal CollectionService = game:GetService(\"CollectionService\")\n\n-- Variables\nlocal paper = workspace:WaitForChild(\"Paper\") :: BasePart\nlocal paperHitbox = paper:WaitForChild(\"Hitbox\") :: BasePart\nlocal currentCamera = workspace.CurrentCamera\n\n-- Private Function\nlocal function getMouseTarget(filterInstances: {Instance}): Instance | nil\n\tlocal mouseLocation = UserInputService:GetMouseLocation()\n\tlocal ray = currentCamera:ViewportPointToRay(mouseLocation.X, mouseLocation.Y)\n\t\n\tlocal params = RaycastParams.new()\n\tparams.FilterType = Enum.RaycastFilterType.Include\n\tparams.FilterDescendantsInstances = f",

The path object basically stores methods and info on a path that is being used to generate the spaceship. \n I\u2019m confused about if there is also a better way to go about this.

I decided to fix this and make a new communication system: \n Client is doing the first raycast, and if it\u2019s successful, it waits raycast1.Distance/bulletSpeed and fires another raycast that finally shows a hitmarker, makes bullet hole and sends info (position and direction) to server, where it fires ANOTHER raycast and only then it deals damage or creates an explosion.

That\u2019s very annoying, because 80% of all bullets just don\u2019t deal any damage, but there\u2019s a hitmarker and blood particles. I may perform raycasting from a server and then get the result on client and do hitmarker or bullet hole, but the client will get too much delayed information (Very critical to ingame experience). \n  Is there a way to make such system that will be protected from exploiters, but also register bullets normally?  \n  ",

However, Roblox correctly detects their rotation when dragging another part over them. \n Is there a way to automate converting these MeshParts into regular Parts instead of manually tracing each building with a new Part?

They automatically drop the survivor when they get stunned during this move. \n For some reason, there is a very rare chance that the killer gets sent to the void immediately upon getting stunned out of their grab. I assume this is some sort of roblox physics engine bug with the very high values set to the bodyvelocities maxforce, but are there any work-arounds to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen?

I heard a lot about reusability but I am wondering if there are other benefits. \n Usually my systems/services do need to require each other(they do not have circular dependencies).

So this isn\u2019t exactly a problem but instead, something I haven\u2019t found anywhere on the internet but on ChatGPT with a few prompts and I\u2019d like to help people save their time. \n Usually when you want to send a piece of information from the server to the client or vice-versa, you\u2019d do something like: \n  --Side: Server.\nlocal newSignal = Service.Client.CreateSignal();\nnewSignal:Fire(player, newInfo);\n  \n And then: \n  --Side: Client\nService = Knit.GetService();\nService.newSignal:Connect(function(newInfo)\n   print(\"Got new info:\", newInfo);\nend);\n  \n Cool. But what if I want to similarly warn all my controllers (client side) that something on the client side happened that is interesting to many controllers? If I wasn\u2019t clear enough, I\u2019ll give you an example. \nI was trying to warn all my controllers (UIController, AimController, etc\u2026) that the client connected a gamepad (device switch). That way, UIController could instantly change icons accordingly to the new device type. \nThe solution is: We, naturally, have a InputController that listens to UserInputService.GamepadConnected/Disconnected. That exact same controller will create the signal and fire it when needed. \n  --Side: Client\n\nfunction InputController:KnitStart()\n    local function warnEveryone()\n    --???\n    end;\n    UserInputService.GamepadConnected:Connect(warnEveryone)\n    UserInputService.GamepadDisconnected:Connect(warnEveryone)\nend;\n  \n We can\u2019t use Knit.CreateSignal() here, I\u2019ve tried and it says that we tried to call a nil value. \nThe solution is to go straight to the Packages.Signal module and use the \u2018new\u2019 function to manually create ourselves a signal like so: \n  --Side: Client\nlocal SignalModule = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Signal);\n\n\nfunction InputController:KnitStart()\n    self.newSignal = SignalModule.new();\n    local function warnEveryone()\n        self.newSignal:Fire(newDevice);--This will warn everyone that used InputController.newSignal:Connect(function)\n    end;\n    Use",

      "content": "  Summary:  \nI was testing the new Roblox ban feature using the Open Cloud API while building a Discord bot for our moderators. To verify everything worked, I repeatedly banned and unbanned my own account. At some point, either due to sending too many requests too quickly or a brief Roblox server disruption, the ban state stopped syncing. Since then, I\u2019ve been stuck as banned, even though the ban manager, API, etc., reports that I\u2019m unbanned. \n  Full Explanation  \nI created and tested the ban and unban commands of a Discord bot I developed by banning and unbanning myself several times. After confirming that permanent bans worked correctly, I tested the time ban command as well. I entered a value slightly over 1,000 days, which the bot correctly converted into seconds for the API. I verified the ban by attempting to join the game, checked the ban list command (which also worked), and then unbanned myself. The bot reported the unban as successful. After that, I went to sleep and didn\u2019t join the game for about two months, since development had already shifted to a new project and I was only working on moderation commands on the side. A few weeks ago, I noticed that I was still banned. \n \u25cf The first thing I tried was the Roblox Game Ban Manager, but I didn\u2019t appear on the banned list at all. So I manually added a new ban and then unbanned myself again, hoping it would force a sync. This didn\u2019t work. \n \u25cf I then tried unbanning myself through the Discord bot again, which also failed. \n \u25cf Another developer ran an unban script from the in game console (since Studio does not allow ban or unban requests), but that didn\u2019t work either. \n \u25cf I also confirmed that there were no alternative accounts or other bans affecting the experience, there is literally no one on the ban list. \n I waited a bit, nothing changed. \nI switched devices, same issue. \nI checked every place inside the same universe and even all other experiences under the same group, nothing that might cause this issue",

Everything works fine normally, but I\u2019m running into a problem: \n When a player gets teleported to a new server by SoftShutdown, the default Roblox backpack overlay shows up on top of my Satchel custom backpack. This doesn\u2019t happen on the first join, only after a SoftShutdown teleport. \n I think it\u2019s a timing issue\u2014Satchel initializes a bit late and the default backpack GUI is already visible. \n Has anyone successfully used Satchel with SoftShutdown? How do you properly prevent the default Roblox backpack from appearing after a teleport? \n Any tips would be greatly appreciated! \n Thanks in advance! \n          1  1849\u00d7981 184 KB         \n   ",

Does anyone have experience with this? Would it actually cause this much lag? \n Another idea I had is making a custom water part that is pre-deformed in blender around the hull of the ship, it would still be animated like regular water, and the actual ocean water mesh would only deform in a large rectangle around the ship, but the custom ship water mesh would create a seamless blend between the two, covering the hole. Would it cause less lag by only making the water deform in a basic rectangle like this? \n We could also only make these calculations happen for players below deck, and only for people who are close enough to actually see it. For example, if you are on ship A and see ship B in the distance, players on ship A do not need to have ship B\u2019s water deformation calculated. They can\u2019t even see it, so what\u2019s the point? \n Someone suggested we use terrain deformation and just make water deform or replace into air inside the hitbox of the ship\u2019s hull which could work but it might also cause a significant amount of lag, according to the scripter \n We also cannot use the glass method to make water not render below decks, it would interfere with particle effects. \n Perhaps there is a method to use a mesh without deforming at all, and just m",

Include screenshots / videos if possible! \nThe legs are behaving a bit weird on the R6 idle animation. It\u2019s a small issue, yeah, but I\u2019m trying to find a fix to it because when someone is idle, it looks like they\u2019re floating a bit sometimes. \n  What solutions have you tried so far?  Did you look for solutions on the Creator Hub? \nI searched up my exact issue but I couldn\u2019t find anyone else having the issue. The R6 idle animation I\u2019m using is the default one on every R6 rig you create through the \u201cRig Builder\u201d. \n \n Hello everyone, I am infact making a game which immediately destroys your Roblox Avatar and replaces it with a custom rig (instead of the \u201cStarterCharacter\u201d solution), because my rig is created through code. I have a function called \u201cr6()\u201d, and all it does, is that it creates a R6 rig through a table (the table can contain accessories, because my game does not use your Roblox Avatar, instead it makes your own one which you can decorate and other stuff) \n My issue with this is, the R6 legs are acting a bit weird on the idle animation. I can see this difference when I create a R6 rig through the Rig Builder in Studio instead of my custom Rig, where the legs are in place in the idle animation. \n I have tried to copy the exact Motor6D CFrames, the exact Attachment CFrames, etc., but it\u2019s still doing the same issue. My \u201cAnimate\u201d script is (basically) the same as Roblox\u2019s \u201cAnimate\u201d script (I only removed the empty lines so the code is a tiny tiny bit shorter) \n I hope that it doesn\u2019t matter that the PrimaryPart of my Rig is the HumanoidRootPart instead of the Head. \n Here\u2019s the \u201cr6()\u201d function: \n  local r6 = function(ch)\n\tif (typeof(ch) ~= \"table\") then ch = {}; end;\n\tlocal m = Instance.new(\"Model\");\n\tlocal h = Instance.new(\"Humanoid\", m);\n\th.Break",

      "content": "  Hello everyone    , I hope you\u2019re all doing well. This is my first post, so I\u2019ll introduce myself briefly. I\u2019ve been creating Roblox games for almost seven years now, and this past year I\u2019ve been refining my skills in the internal workings of the game. Certainly, after mastering Lua programming, as the saying goes, once you understand a topic, you can then suggest things because you truly grasp it. \n Anyway, I simply wanted to share a simple alternative for those looking for a solution to WaitForChild, a nightmare for many fellow scripters, I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true. \n I\u2019ve been searching like crazy for an alternative to waitforchild, but I haven\u2019t found a framework for these child settings, like waitforchild or findfirstchild. I\u2019m referring to something more customizable and optimized. Below, I\u2019ll list the main problems, especially with waitforchild. I might cover findfirstchild another day. \n  Main problems with WaitForChild:  \n-Well, I want to tell you that when I started using waitforchild\u2014because we\u2019ve all used it without question when we started programming, trusting in it\u2014I ran into my first big problem. When I created my 10th game, studying and improving it with each game, I think that\u2019s what we do. But here I saw an error I hadn\u2019t seen before. I repeat, I was very new to it, but waitforchild is NOT RELIABLE, especially if you\u2019re searching for something in the workspace from the client. I\u2019m referring specifically to that issue, without forgetting client preloading. \n It didn\u2019t load an asset I had; it was an egg in the workspace, being searched for with waitforchild from the client\u2026 This is where the terror of every novice coder began. Sorry if I\u2019m talking too much about such a simple solution, but it\u2019s my first post. Thanks for your patience. Besides, I think we like reading these posts and seeing them as crazy adventures of each of the members of [the community/group]. Roblox developer, well, the terror began, it showed up in yellow saying it wasn\u2019t loadin",

The way I went about it is having several status effects stored in a file within server storage that can be cloned into a folder in players. The scripts would act independently of each other and be simple enough to use as a framework for other status effects. I went through and programmed each one myself. \n Problem is: whenever they end, I freeze for around a half second to a full second. I checked with most status effects, and they all end this way. Here\u2019s a quick overview of how they work; Main script and parent of all other attributes, this handles the status effects main job. Inside that script, there\u2019s two intvalues, one for strength and duration, meaning they can be shortened or extended from abilities. There is also a local script for handling UI effects, and a remote event so the main script can communicate to the local script. \n I\u2019d really appreciate a way to optimize these so I don\u2019t get this hefty lag, its very very annoying. Any other recommendations for my current system are also very appreciated! I\u2019m still a beginner scripter, and while I\u2019m proud of myself, I want this to not be infuriating to play with. I\u2019ll attach the main script, the gui script and a video of what happens (using my slowness effect as example): \n both strength and duration are set to 5 in this example. \n Main script (serverside): \n  local timeleft = script.Length\nlocal Strength = script.Strength\nlocal char = script.Parent.Parent\nlocal hum = char:FindFirstChildOfClass(\"Humanoid\")\nlocal event = script.TimeTick\n\nlocal plr = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(char)\n\nlocal states = char:WaitForChild(\"Stats\")\nlocal defaultWalk = states.WalkSpeed.Value\nlocal defaultRun = states.SprintSpeed.Value\n\nprint(tostring(defaultWalk) .. \" | \" .. tostring(defaultRun))\n\nwhile true do\n\tif timeleft.Value &gt; 0 then -- checks if effect is ended\n\t\ttimeleft.Value -= 1 -- tick\n\t\t\n\t\tstates.WalkSpeed.Value = defaultWalk * (0.1 * Strength.Value)\n\t\tsta",

I can figure out the cooldown system and whatnot, but I am having a hard time deciding for a good flow with abilities. \nEssentially, this is the current flow without network: \n \n Player presses ability \n Player gets put in animation \n Hitbox plays at some point after a delay \n If a player is in hitbox, the animation continues, and the victims position/rotation is changed to match animation, and an animation is played for victim. \n At some points during animation, damage is dealt to the victim \n \n Previously, I was thinking of having a system with animation markers that would report damage and moments where to deal them. But since client has authority over its model, it could just play whatever animation it\u2019d want. \nBut what is the best flow then? I thought of having clientsided hitreg for the hitbox that\u2019s sanitychecked by the server (current m1 system as well) and then just having server playing damage after some delays. But this could cause desync between clients, although I think it wouldn\u2019t be that relevant since it\u2019s only timing with animation. \nI also wanted to spawn vfx at specific moments, which markers would\u2019ve been perfect for but now I am unsure after realizing this major security flaw. \n I am just posting to see if people know what the standard for this is, if there is a better way I am not seeing, etc. Please criticize my idea.

This does not happen on desktop or when canceling via a keyboard input. It is such a one-off I have no clue why its doing it. \n Some context: this camera work is done via a local script and below is the module script that handles the camera: \n  local KickCamera = {}\n\n-- Set the camera to track the ball\nfunction KickCamera.Start(ball)\n\tlocal RunService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\tlocal cam = workspace.CurrentCamera\n\tcam.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Track\n\tcam.CameraSubject = ball\nend\n\n-- Reset the camera back to the player\nfunction KickCamera.Stop(player)\n\tlocal cam = workspace.CurrentCamera\n\tcam.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Custom\n\t\n\tlocal humanoid = player.Character and player.Character:FindFirstChildOfClass(\"Humanoid\")\n\tif not humanoid then error(\"Unable to find humanoid for cam reset\") return end\n\t\n\tcam.CameraSubject = humanoid\nend\n\nreturn KickCamera\n  \n The flow is like this in the local player script: Create Ball \u2192 KickCamera.Start(ball) \u2192 Click the button \u2192 button calls KickCamera.Stop(player) \u2192 Camera returns but it snaps counter-clockwise a few degrees \u2192 Crash Out \n Again this works perfectly clicking the button desktop or when using a key press to call the KickCamera.Stop method. I have tried storing the camera CFrame before the  Start  method and then restoring it after the stop method but that didn\u2019t work either. I even waited for the render step to finish before attempting to restore the camera CFrame. \n Has anyone experienced something similar and could offer some advice or help? The closest thing I found to this was this thread here:  Changing CameraType to Custom Resets Camera Position  but its been apparently fixed so I assume I am doing something wrong or misunderstanding some fundamental operation related to cameras in mobile ",

(where your animation changes according to what w/a/s/d keys you have down in shift lock) I have previously made a system like this, but I\u2019ve now ran into the following issues: \nFirstly, due to the several amount of animations, if I implement this into the default animate script, spamming different keys causes the animations to look weird, as they glitch together. \nLerping doesn\u2019t work because after lerping when you stop moving the character looks weird for a bit before returning to the idle animation. Also as I am making a soccer game, I need more customization as the ball must roll differently. \nEven if I combine them, the lerping issue persists. I was wondering what the best way to go about this would be. ",

But when using a very simple set of data (eg just a array of integers) is compressing still useful? \n Just passing a simple set of data, \n  -- a remote event (assume)\nlocal Event \n-- normal table with integers\nlocal tab = {0,1,20,7}\n\n-- a buffer with the same integers as 8-bit unsigned shorts (assume)\nlocal buf\n\n-- Sending the data\nEvent:FireServer(tab)\nEvent:FireServer(bug)\n  \n I assume in this case Roblox may compress the table to pass.

Previously I parented the ball to the character which had it, and used a motor6d. This let me animate easily, and it let me easily implement things like idle or running anims without anything extra. It\u2019s a tad bit buggy and might not be the best performance wise, so I\u2019m wondering if i should keep it that way or change it. Thanks. ",

The block is supposed to be placed near a block, and if the position of your cursor is invalid, it should place a block as close as possible to it without failing any of the checks. \n Like in BedWars, if you look into the void or down when the floor is far away, you should place the block near the player so they can bridge. \n Here\u2019s a video showing an example of a similar system (I couldn\u2019t figure out how to make the vide o work). \n \n   \n     \n   \n \n\n \n  What is the issue?

I know it might not be the best way to hold up a plane above the ground considering there are methods like Raycast Suspension (which probably even exist if springs worked well), but I wanted a quicker way to finalize my side project without spending 3 days scripting it. Will roblox ever improve the physics? \n         Zrzut ekranu 2025-11-07 192257  1451\u00d7980 131 KB         \n         Zrzut ekranu 2025-11-07 192354  1383\u00d71009 118 KB         \n Now, I made my plane very light (204.543Kg) which SHOULD be good for the springs to handle. But no; either it flings the whole thing or collapses down to the wheels. No configuration fixes that. \n My main inquiry is; are there any ways to \u201cstrengthen\u201d the springs? Any other ways to create durable suspension without sacrificing time? Or even an open source Raycast script. Thanks in advance. ",

However, it derails on banking. \n We have normal HingeConstraints / BallSocket, which became too wobbly or still derail. \n Not to mention, we look through the creator hub, old train tutorials, devforum threads. Most are pre-2023 and still use the old 4-hinge method that breads on banking. \n We know the TrackAnchor with the UniversalConstraint method that supposed to fix this (which every big subway group uses it now), but we can\u2019t figure out the exact, simple setup that actually works completely. \n If anyone would drop a minimal open .rbxm (or step-by-step with pictures) of a working front and rear bogie using the aforementioned TrackAnchor and the UniversalConstraint that survives heavy banking, that would be great. \n It would save us (and probably half the train community) weeks of pain and frustration. \n Post-editing note: If anyone has any knowledge about tilted rails, particularly in relation to superelevation, I would deeply appreciate your help. It would mean a lot to me to have that information. Thank you so much! ",

I have this issue, where my animations break on the character after changing the mesh id. \n In my game, your character is a duck and players can use different skins (these different skins have different mesh ids, texture ids, mesh-part colors, mesh-part materials, etc.). All in game animations work, its just the hat that stops following. \n A snippet of how I change their avatars (via server): \n         image  374\u00d7446 21.7 KB         \n  \n--[[ \nTo be clear: \n- AS = AssetService (Used to load the new meshpart, since MeshId is read only)\n- part is the part inside the character that the player chose to equip (its the same model, same structure) [See attachement 2 for structure of avatar] \n\n- itemInChar is the part inside the player character\n- What happens is: I assign to the part that is inside the **player.Character.MeshPart (itemInChar)** the MeshId and TextureID property of the MeshPart (part) that player wants to equip\n]]\n\nlocal meshId = part.MeshId\n\n\tlocal S,F = pcall(function()\n\t\tlocal meshPart = AS:CreateMeshPartAsync(meshId)\n\t\titemInChar:ApplyMesh(meshPart)\n\t\titemInChar.TextureID = part.TextureID\n\t\tmeshPart:Destroy()\n        end)\n\n  \n The custom character rig (a Duck) uses Motor6Ds for animation. I want to dynamically change the \u201cHat\u201d accessory by updating its  MeshId  and  TextureId  via a script when the player equips a new skin. The Hat should continue to animate (bob/tilt) along with the head/beak just like the default hat does. \n   What is the issue? \n The default hat animates perfectly (Screenshot 1). However, as soon as my script changes the  MeshId  of the Hat part (using  ApplyMesh  or manual property assignment),  the Hat stops animating . (Screenshot 3, the one below) \n         image  778\u00d7800 45.6 KB         \n It seems like the AnimationTrack no longer \u201crecognizes\u201d the part once the MeshId changes, causing the Hat to freeze in place relative to the RootPart, even though it is still named \u201cHa",

The amount of buildings is massive, so the  entire  building is being turned into a singular block LOD as soon as you get out of direct eyeshot of it. I believe this is set to around 120 studs before it turns \n \n \n Smaller details such as mailboxes, lamp posts, small furniture, flower pots etc are all set to detail_tiny using VisTools at radius of 45 and are removed from the workspace at that radius \n \n \n Streaming is on, with a min radius of 1024. I wanted to keep this a lot smaller, but this was not possible - I believe due to the amount of items in the workspace. As soon as a new chunk renders, with a smaller radius it just completely freeze frames \n \n \n StreamingMesh has not really been played around with at all, everything is currently set to default \n \n \n Almost all interior lights and exterior lights are radius based, and are put into ReplicatedStorage by default \u2013 only being turned \u201con\u201d with a scripted light switch.

I\u2019m thinking I have to create a bunch of hinges for the segments, but I\u2019m not well versed at all on constraints. \n \n You may then include any further details. \n The door that I just made took 4 1/2 hours to make drag-able. I was quite confused on how to set the constraints up together, but finally after reading through the Forums and watching many videos I was able to get it working to my liking! I\u2019ve also created some buttons so the door can also act automatic! \n \n   \n\n       drive.google.com \n   \n\n   \n          \n\n\n\n  2025-10-20 13-12-47.mp4  \n\n Google Drive file. \n\n   \n\n   \n    \n    \n   \n\n    \n \n\n The video file is too large to upload here. \n I\u2019d just simply like for it instead to move straight up and down, move in-segments.

      "content": " Hello. I am new to developing in Roblox as well as to the forum, so if this comes off as poorly researched or hard to read, I apologize. \n \n \n  What do I want to achieve?  \nI want to create an NPC that can replicate the player\u2019s movement. The NPC would have to precisely replicate these movements, so to do this I record the player\u2019s parts\u2019 CFrames every frame, and then replay them but with the NPC\u2019s parts. The NPC would have a different avatar to the player, which is what makes the task challenging. \n \n \n  What is the issue?  \nIn order to achieve this, the size of the NPC\u2019s parts have to be the same as the players. The main issue is that since there are so many different avatars, it is hard to standardize the sizes without breaking some players\u2019 avatars. I do not want to change the player\u2019s avatar in any major way (I am fine with removing certain UGC items if necessary, but I don\u2019t want to mess up their avatar by removing their hair, for example). I also do not want to set the NPC\u2019s part sizes to the player\u2019s, as that can allow parts of my game to be spoofed. \n \n \n  What solutions have you tried so far?  \nI have tried using avatar settings, however I don\u2019t think it is able to precisely change the sizes of each part. I tried to set the player\u2019s part sizes when they join the game with a script, however this seems to break parts of their character (welds and animations, from what I have seen). \n \n \n In Summary: Is there some easy way to set the player\u2019s proportions without completely breaking their character?

For rendering the lights, I decided to create a part in each cell and put a point light in it with a brightness based on the light value of the cell. The problem with this is that it does not look good especially at max graphics. As you can see in the image, the circles are overlapping and it doesn\u2019t light up any walls or roofs. \n          Screenshot 2025-10-11 224347  1303\u00d7621 294 KB         \n Arguably, the lighting does look better on lower graphics. \n         Screenshot 2025-10-11 224524  1314\u00d7626 102 KB         \n My next idea was to try using surface lights, and this time placing them up near the roof and having them project down. It gives an interesting squarish pattern and lights up the walls and roof. But my main concern is that you can\u2019t see anything on lower graphics. \n With max graphics: \n         Screenshot 2025-10-11 224819  1303\u00d7617 277 KB         \n With lowest graphics: \n         Screenshot 2025-10-11 224856  1301\u00d7610 40.2 KB         \n So I\u2019m looking for a solution or idea that is: \n \n Cell based, accurate to the grid and light level assigned in each cell \n Lights up the walls and ceiling \n Looks decent on max and low graphics, doesn\u2019t need to be realistic \n \n Thank you for your reply!

When I play the animation the model moves as expected, except for the models weapon.   Looking at the rig I assume its because the weapon doesnt have a bone so the animatin doesnt move it. \n I have tried to weld the weapon to the hand and use motor6Ds which dont solve the issue. \n I then added a bone to the weapon and placed that under the LHand bone but that still didint help. \n The root part is anchored and all other parts are unanchored. \n I assume the bit I am missing is associating the new weapon bone with the weapon mesh, but I cant see a way to do that.  Any assistance from experienced custom model and rigs folks would be greatly appreciated, \n Kind regars, \n RocketMan \n         Example_Roblox  1535\u00d7788 308 KB         ",

      "content": " My original post was based on my lack of knowledge of mesh instancing at the time, and is misleading. You do not need to worry about head mesh tri counts, and in the age of widespread UGC it\u2019d be futile to do so anyways. I\u2019ve tried to delete this post but the request was denied, so the post is still viewable below. \n \n So for optimization reasons with building assets, I decided to check out the roblox r6 character model in blender to see if there was anything I could make better. I look in the corner and see about 1.1k triangles, which was really strange. I suspected it was the head, so imagine my suprise when I look at the amount of triangles the head had and see  this:  \n          image  1159\u00d7841 117 KB         \n  Almost 80% of the triangles in the R6 rig is taken up by the head  \n Yikes. \n I think one of the biggest reasons for this is probably because of how high-poly the head is. Looking at the top view of the head, it has 36 \u201cedges.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s the equivalent of this cylinder + smooth shading. \n          image  516\u00d7370 34.6 KB         \n While it does make for a nice round looking model, personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really worth the performance, which I will get to in a second when comparing it to the new model I made: \n          image  1032\u00d7703 108 KB         \n I used 16 edges instead for the cylinder + smooth shading. You can only really notice a big difference when you\u2019re staring at the top, but if you\u2019re looking at it from a mostly horizontal angle (which is probably how you\u2019ll see it most of the time in-game) there isn\u2019t really much of a difference besides sun reflection. \n The game I\u2019m working on also has characters that usually wear hats or some kind of headgear anyway, so the fact that the head looks kinda low poly from the top doesn\u2019t really matter, and most people probably won\u2019t freak out over your heads not being super round. \n Left = Roblox head, Right = My head \n         image  343\u00d7142 43.6 KB         \n Now, on to performance.

      "content": " Hi everyone, \n I\u2019m creating a custom car system in Roblox using VehicleSeat and Constraints, specifically SpringConstraint for suspension and CylindricalConstraint for wheels. \n Here are the problems I\u2019m facing: \n \n \n When I press W to drive straight, the car turns slightly on its own, drifting even with no steering. \n \n \n At very high speeds, around 200 studs per second, the car starts to wobble side to side and becomes unstable. \n \n \n Over time, after lots of turning, the car acts  slippery  and loses stable steering. \n \n \n Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried so far: \n \n I lowered the center of gravity by adding a ballast part under the car. \n I switched from normal wheels to sphere wheels. The visual wheel is just for show, while the sphere serves as the actual physics wheel. \n I adjusted the stiffness and damping of the SpringConstraint, testing both high and low values. \n I reset the steering angle to 0 when there\u2019s no input. \n I limited the steering angle to about 15 degrees. \n I also tried using a NoCollisionConstraint between the wheels and the body. \n \n Despite these efforts, the same problems continue: \n \n The car won\u2019t drive straight without veering off. \n At high speeds, around 200 studs per second, the car wobbles heavily and is nearly undriveable. \n \n  My questions:  \n \n Is this a CylindricalConstraint axis alignment issue? \n Do I need anti-roll stabilization (BodyGyro / AlignOrientation)? \n How do I stop the high-speed wobble while keeping realistic suspension? \n Any way to reduce the  slippery steering effect  after multiple turns? \n \n Here are two different scripts: (Sphere version and Normal version) \n  \n Any advice or working examples would be very helpful. \n Here file: \n Car test by Biem.rbxl  (858.8 KB) ",

Two days ago, I tried using Moon Animator 2, but for some reason, it isn\u2019t recognizing any of my models as rigs (and thus won\u2019t let me animate them correctly). \n In one specific example, I created a cat model for the player to become in part of my game. I built the model with the default Studio modeling tools, and rigged it (again with RigEdit Lite). I made sure to use only joints and not welds (though I did weld the HumanoidRootPart to the LowerTorso). However, Moon Animator 2 does not allow me to choose the \u201crig\u201d option when adding the model. I looked up this issue online and found a video, a Reddit post, and a forum post. The video said that I needed to set the PrimaryPart, which I had already done (I set it to HumanoidRootPart). The Reddit post said that I needed to add a humanoid and set the PrimaryPart (I already added a humanoid). The forum post suggested adding a humanoid, setting the PrimaryPart, and adding an AnimationController (so then I tried adding the controller, which did not fix the problem). A reply from the original poster in 2021 said that they had already added all of those things (just as I did) and were still facing the same problem. There was no reply, so I was still lost. \n I\u2019ve attached the model\u2019s Explorer part hierarchy. What is the problem? Is it related to the model or Moon Animator 2? Are there any alternatives? (I know there\u2019s a default animator, but I heard Moon was great, and I got it when it was free). \n     \n     image  252\u00d7883 22.1 KB     \n    ",

Basically have a tiling system similar to Rise of Nations, World of Revolution, or like bigger games like Hearts of Iron 4 (HOI4) or Victoria 2. \n     \n     image  1920\u00d71077 103 KB     \n    \n    \n     Screenshot 2025-04-10 221459  1121\u00d7897 70.3 KB     \n    \n(Tile size above for reference in UK) \n I\u2019ve already tried various methods such as using  Voronoi-Style Tiles  or downloading different types of SVG files to be exported to Blender, but I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to make it work. If anyone has anyone clues to help me achieve this tiling system, I would very much appreciate it if you could s",

Firstly, I want to have these glowing particles which are already designed appear instantly with my model. Secondly, I want the model that these particles are attached to, to always be lit up. \n Now the main problem I am facing here is when I first clone my model with the particles then parent it I am tweening it\u2019s size (not 100% this contributes to the issue) and then when the model is fully visible theres a slight delay before the particles appear. The other main issue is the lighting, I have a sun in my game and anytime I tilt my camera down the model goes dark \n          image  455\u00d7336 42.4 KB         \n as apposed to its normal look \n          image  551\u00d7367 58 KB         \n I\u2019m not sure what causes this, and how to fix it! \n I\u2019ve tried every kind of light and it either doesn\u2019t work, barely works, or I have to noticeably affect the surrounding parts with this blaring light \n Refrence of my inspiration \n          image  744\u00d7650 108 KB         \n Do note that in anime adventures there is darkening but it is not as extreme as in my game where the model goes pitch black. \n If you require more information don\u2019t be afraid to ask!

This might sound obvious in hindsight, but it caused me days of debugging. \n I ran into an issue where the front wheels of my truck would wobble or spin erratically, especially during steering. I spent hours tweaking mass properties, trying different constraint setups, rewriting scripts \u2014 basically  reinventing the wheel  \u2014 and nothing worked. \n It turns out that when you scale up the vehicle, if the axle or suspension geometry remains at default (especially when using HingeConstraints or cylindrical attachments), the physics engine can\u2019t properly stabilize the wheel under torque and steering forces. The result is unpredictable rotational behavior, especially at higher speeds or with large mass differentials between wheel and chassis. \n After resizing the axles (in proportion to the larger wheels), the instability was completely resolved. \n So if anyone runs into the same issue \u2014 especially when upscaling vehicles \u2014 make sure your axle geometry matches your wheel size. Hopefully, this saves someone else from the same rabbit hole I went down. ",

Because I have to use blender to add a  gradient texture to my weapons, I can\u2019t use studios material properties to add the stud texture to it, I have to do it in blender. This means that I can\u2019t use one of those \u201cmulti Ui gradient sheets\u201d because there isn\u2019t a way to put the studs over it. Right now my current solution to this is to create my own gradient with the stud texture on top of it. Example: \n         LightGrey  512\u00d7512 157 KB         \n This comes with its own problems. First of all, its extremely inefficient as I have to create a new gradient every time and slap the stud texture over it. Secondly, each texture for my weapons will be different which I believe will take up more memory. \n Does anyone have an idea as to how I can approach this more efficiently? ",

You can see it a little when i run out of stamina, but the \u201cfill\u201d gets a little distorted and doesn\u2019t fit the outline of the bar when it\u2019s almost empty.  I\u2019ve got several moving parts that I can think of that might be causing this issue. For one, im using a frame with ClipsDescendents to \u201cshrink\u201d the fill, but the fill is an image that is a trapezoid and not a rectangle. I dont really care enough to fix that atm tho lol. But i would like some feedback on everything showcased. \n The inventory panel has a lot of placeholder stuff for now, but the panel in the upper right is going to be a character panel that shows your equipped items. Spacing and whatnot is not really optimized/polished yet. \n Here is my concept for the inventory UI:  inventory concept ui - Album on Imgur  ",

But this seems to be different for every motor making any animations made in blender utterly meaningless unless I change the motor rotations manually which is imprecise and very time consuming. \n \n \n  What solutions have you tried so far?  Did you look for solutions on the Creator Hub? \nI\u2019ve tried changing the bone roll properties but this only SOMETIMES works and even if it does work, its not always in the right axis for all axis\u2019. \n \n \n Take a look at how it looks. \nExpected Pose (Test Pose): \n         image  731\u00d7763 95.1 KB         \n Imported Pose (Test): \n         image  657\u00d7777 35.6 KB         \n As you can see, the expected pose for the legs is out and to the back. \nHowever, on import, the legs move out and forward instead of back. This is a huge problem to animate. \n The Front and Top faces are correct in Roblox, and the Blender Import axis\u2019 are -Y and Z for Forward and Up axis\u2019 respectively, so there is nothing wrong with the axis export/import. \n The Legs are all i\u2019ve bothered to pose at the moment since I know the arms will have a similar issue, I dont want to move forward until I fully understand how to fix this problem. \n I hope someone has the answer by now because this tech has been out for years now\u2026 \n Thanks ",

The one specifically Im using are the R15 Anime Boy from Rig Builder (see screenshot below). But I dont think they are fully animation ready.

Does anyone know if Roblox themselves provide an animation ready humanoid template to create animations in blender with? I was hoping to export the animations then import them into roblox without the character skin so animations can be applied to any R15.

Normally, I would create an animation from a third party source (Maya, sometimes Blender), then convert that animation into an FBX file, and finally import that into the built-in Animation Editor in studio. \n However in recent time, importing the FBX File fails to actually load any keyframes onto the timeline. This isn\u2019t a rig issue, as I can play other animations that are already published on Roblox. Not only this, but I\u2019ve made sure to follow the correct exporting process to ensure it can properly import into studio. \n I\u2019m not exactly sure if it\u2019s a problem in studio, or the third party applications, but I\u2019m pretty lost on how to fix this, and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s an easy way to fix this?

Over time, this offset compounds and eventually causes the last item to be pushed completely  outside  the visible area of the ScrollingFrame. \n What\u2019s strange is that the first few duplicates behave correctly, but the more items I add, the worse the gap becomes. \n  Example of correct sizing (just 1 extra object):  \n         First1  939\u00d7546 159 KB         \n  Example after many duplicates (scrolled to the bottom):  \n         Issue1  955\u00d7461 152 KB         \n As you can see, that bottom gap gradually increases with more items added. \n I\u2019m stuck trying to figure out why this is happening or what\u2019s causing the drift. \n Thanks for your time!

After spending about a week testing and researching, I\u2019m pretty sure the problem isn\u2019t my scripts or buildings it\u2019s the terrain itself. \n Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: \n \n The map is massive, roughly  7,660 \u00d7 3,936 \u00d7 13,140 studs . \n I removed all models, buildings, scripts, and decorations just to test the terrain alone. \n When I walk around in Play mode:\n \n Ping starts at  50\u201370 , which is fine. \n After walking for 1\u20132 minutes, ping slowly climbs, sometimes reaching  1,000 , even without StreamingEnabled or any scripts. \n \n \n I\u2019ve tried a bunch of things already:\n \n Lowering the terrain as much as possible \n Smoothing jagged hills, mountains, and trenches multiple times \n Subtracting extreme peaks and valleys \n Turning off 2022 Terrain materials \n Anchoring all mesh parts and unions \n \n \n \n Nothing seems to stop the spikes. \n From what I understand, the main problem is  voxel complexity . Even if the terrain is \u201clow,\u201d millions of voxels from mountains, hills, and trenches can overwhelm the client, especially on a map this size. \n Right now, I\u2019m considering a few options: \n \n Flatten and smooth combat areas as much as possible \n Replace distant hills and mountains with  low-poly MeshParts  to keep visuals but reduce voxels \n Split the map into zones using  TeleportService , so players only load part of the map at a time \n Maybe use  StreamingEnabled  carefully with optimized chunk sizes \n \n I\u2019m not sure if hardware my PC/laptop is part of the problem. \n I\u2019d really appreciate any advice on  optimizing huge terrain maps  in Roblox, especially for WW2-style battlefields with mountains, trenches, and villages. \n Thanks a lot!

They look really good! \n My one problem is just the positioning of the arms and the legs. The way they bend feels rather unnatural and the arms all seem to want to bend inwards from the shoulder and stick right to the body\u2019s sides. Besides editing all keyframes manually which might seem like a pain, I\u2019m not sure how I can get the arms to look more natural and not, well, twisted like this. \n For the record, I\u2019ve tried many different things, including just exporting the armature and using it as the Mixamo animation preview character (auto rigs). Previewing animations on just the armature actually shows the intended effect I\u2019m looking for. Notice how the arms do not bend inward on the armature unlike how they bend on the full figure in the picture above. \n     \n     image  1920\u00d7969 243 KB     \n    \n Any help on how I can get my rig to follow the same motion as the armature? \n Included below is all the files I am currently using. There are rigs, the armature as well as cleaned FBX animations that can be loaded onto a rebuilt rig and exported. \n  BlenderTest.zip  (661.5 KB) \n CleanedAnimation* files are FBX animation data that can be imported to a rebuilt rig. ExportedR15Rig is the fully exported rig (all export items selected) that I give to Mixamo before picking and downloading an animation. R15Rig is the exported rig from Studio that can be rebuilt with the Blender animation plugin. R15RigArmatureOnly is an exported FBX that can be given to Mixamo to see the animation previews which, when played on the armature, differ from exporting everything else and then importing the animation data back after cleaning it up (Mixamo renames bones for some reason if you export everythin",

Wanted to start with trying to make an outline effect and a stereoscopic 3D style effect. Though it was an absolute nightmare to achieve without clipping, I did manage to make it in blender - absolute nightmare to pull it off in a way that gets rid of clipping, but I did manage to make it happen. In Blender, it looks like so: \n         Screenshot 2025-09-21 223546  670\u00d7452 40.5 KB                  Screenshot 2025-09-21 223620  750\u00d7438 43.7 KB         \n I was going to continue on and try to make another addon bit to mimic a bit of halftone texturing on the headphones (this would\u2019ve just been a normal mesh, not any backface culling shenanigans) before I realized that I actually have to get this into Roblox somehow. So I tried, and totally failed. \nI\u2019m not actually that well-versed in blender, so I\u2019m relying on an LLM for a lot of help (if you feel that\u2019s tacky and want to shame me feel free) but absolutely nothing that it suggested or that I tried on my own worked. I successfully combined everything into one mesh, but it still relies on 3 materials, as seen. \n         Screenshot 2025-09-21 224004  1585\u00d7690 106 KB         \n I tried baking it into one texture, but I can\u2019t really get it to work no matter what I do. I\u2019m having an issue where any setting I use to do UV unwrapping results in unwrapping areas of the mesh that need to be different colors on top of each other, so I\u2019m not sure if I can functionally bake it all into one texture as I have it now - but I frankly don\u2019t really know how to fix it, and I\u2019m just very, very lost. \n I\u2019m sorry for asking for help from y\u2019all with little to no knowledge of what it is I\u2019m actually doing or how to use Blender like at all. I know that makes it hard to help. But I\u2019m totally lost at this point, so I figured asking here would be a decent last-ditch effort. ",

I\u2019ve learnt the pipeline pretty extensively for the last few weeks. \n I discovered from  this video  that the intended way of importing animations with custom armatures is through the  Animation Editor . Since the bulk FBX importer hardly provides support for animations beyond some small stuff - And my animations would get mangled and completely destroyed by it, which I will get to. \n  My question is - What does this Animation Editor option mean?  \n         image  393\u00d7121 3.38 KB         \n \u201cSelected\u201d is the one that works perfectly for me. Why? \n I know what the UI is saying - My mesh is supposedly inconsistent with the one I\u2019m importing the animation onto, but What does \u201cSelected\u201d literally do? Roblox\u2019s documentation has seemingly no reference of this. Why is the \u201cFBX\u201d option \u201crecommended\u201d? \n  As an example, I have a static-pose animation of a pistol, in Blender:  \n         image  412\u00d7283 22.5 KB         \n  This is what the animation looks like in Roblox when I click on \u201cFBX\u201d:  \n         image  564\u00d7333 47.6 KB         \n  This is what the animation looks like in Roblox when I click on \u201cSelected\u201d:  \n         image  460\u00d7303 45 KB         \n (It isn\u2019t broken)  \n  So I\u2019d just like to know what this \u201cSelected\u201d option actually does.  And is there maybe another way of importing animations with the same results? I understand that the FBX option just recreates the effects of the FBX importer. So why is it recommended? I assume I\u2019m doing something wrong for the FBX imports to not work well for me, they always end up mangled. \n I thought this was no big deal, I\u2019ll just use \u201cSelected\u201d and roll with it - until earlier today, when I tried to import animations using this method and the menu  didn\u2019t appear . \n I\u2019ve never intentionally went out of my way to change the meshes or the armatures for that menu to appear - I just usually animate on a different project on Blender.

      "content": " Hi everyone, \n I\u2019m running into persistent attachment placement errors when uploading a bundle to the Marketplace, and I\u2019m looking for help understanding what\u2019s going wrong. \n I created a bundle following the official Roblox guidelines, and it works perfectly when tested in StarterPlayer. Layered clothing and accessories behave as expected. However, when I try to upload the bundle, I constantly get errors stating that attachment positions are invalid. \n Even though I\u2019ve placed the attachments in the correct positions according to documentation, once the model is imported into Roblox Studio, the attachments appear in strange, offset locations. Editing each one manually in Studio to fix it feels inefficient and defeats the purpose of precise placement in modeling tools like Blender or Maya. \n What makes it more confusing: \n \n Modeling tools use cm, but Roblox uses studs, making it hard to predict values. \n Even when I freeze transforms before export, attachments end up with unpredictable coordinates in Studio. \n Even the FBX files provided officially by Roblox throw the same attachment errors, which makes me wonder what \u201cvalid placement\u201d actually means. \n \n     \n     image (8)  1197\u00d71144 149 KB     \n    \n    \n     image (9)  2048\u00d71443 476 KB     \n    \n    \n     image (10)  1920\u00d71616 201 KB     \n    \n In short, the logic behind attachment position validation seems unclear. Also, importing FBX files resets or distorts placement, rendering modeling tool setups meaningless. \n How are other creators managing this process? Is there a correct, recommended workflow for placing attachments that aligns perfectly with Studio validation? \n Any insights or help would be greatly appreciated. \n Thank you! ",

And no matter what i do, the ui shifts. \n Studio example: \n         image  1841\u00d71088 114 KB         \n Now here\u2019s an example of the exact same UI but in-game on the same monitor: \n         image  1881\u00d71007 73.6 KB         \n I have no clue why my UI keeps shifting around despite everything I\u2019ve done to it, is there something I\u2019m missing or something I haven\u2019t done to fix this? How do so many games have nice little UI that\u2019s organized and clean, but I try to do it and it looks like a hurricane passed through my computer. \n If anybody has any tips, ideas, or just any kind of input at this point that\u2019d mean a lot because I am at SUCH a loss. \n If it is needed, here\u2019s a screenshot of my hierarchy in case I\u2019m doing something miserably wrong: \n         image  422\u00d7593 40 KB         \n         image  457\u00d7577 45.6 KB         \nThe rest is just image labels and text labels. I don\u2019t know if maybe i was supposed to use like 50 other frames or what it is, but if anybody can tell me, that\u2019d mean the world to me. \n (Note: The script inside the UI is just for interactions such as closing the UI via the red X button)  \n Thank you for your time, patience, and your help.

I\u2019ve made a full on Combat Structure, Lobby Systems, Shop systems, Movement systems, AI Systems (Pathfinding). Pretty much every system in the book. \n My weakest point is math, I can create a circle using scripts and can position, rotate and do all the basic math points, but things such as Bezier curves I don\u2019t research / know as  I don\u2019t like math . \n I should note that all my games were made by me (Some maps were just stolen from ROBLOX), Yes I did use free to use modules such as Zone+, Profile store and all the good ones but that\u2019s too be expected. \n \n          Showcases  700\u00d7200 99.2 KB         \n \n \nFACE YOUR FEARS \n Game Link:  Face Your Fears - Roblox  \n Probably the first game I tried to get popular, Its my weakest game and is full of bugs.

      "content": "   About Me \n Hello, my name is Ethanaut. I am an experienced programmer, and second year student of Chemical Engineering. I am looking to build team experience and collaborate! \n I am strongly proficient in Calculus (good for tricky features) and Linear Algebra (extremely important for optimization). I am strongly proficient in realistic projectile systems, and I have a solid background in physics. \n I am a passionate developer, I believe strongly in thoroughly understanding everything that I do within development. I do not like buzzwords, or rules without reason. I will not leave you guessing what I am doing for your game, I am detail oriented, and I strongly believe developers should be able to communicate every step of the way to their clients. \n   Skill Set \n \n 4 years of experience with Roblox Luau. (~3000 hours). \n Strongly proficient with efficient and secure server - client replication. \n Extremely familiar with datastores, saving and loading securely. (Handling crashes and data throttles). \n Substantial tycoon and simulator development experience. \n Specialization in simulating realistic projectile systems. \n Proficient and fast troubleshooter. \n \n Some things I see other developers mention often: \n \n Yes, I am proficient in Object Oriented Programming. (This means using objects and their data to perform actions, using classes within classes for low level contexts). \n I have plenty of experience with module scripts and I understand their purpose. (Animation track accessibility across client scripts for organization is a sample use case of mine). \n I strongly understand network ownership and replication. \n I have lots of experience in physics assemblies and rendering models efficiently. \n \n   Showcase \n Attached below is some showcase of a game I developed completely on my own, and a quick introduction to my first large scale solo development project. \n \u2013 Star Quarries \u2013  \n   \n       \n\n       Roblox \n   \n\n   \n       \n\n  Star Quarries  \n\n   Explore, Mine, Bu",

I\u2019m a proficient scripter with 5+ years of experience. \nI first began with building late 2019 and later learned scripting - around April 2020 - as it was a necessity for me to achieve what I wished to create with my builds at the time. Later on, I found my passion in scripting. \n I consider myself well-versed in the ins and outs of Roblox scripting and Luau -  even made a Luau parser in luau as a side-project one time  -.

Over time, I moved from random prototypes to  systems-focused development : inventory systems, scalable UIs, PvE combat logic, tycoon games mechanics, and more. \nMy goal has always been the same: \n Build clean, optimized games with strong systems and tight feedback loops.  \n \n \n And maybe \u2014 if I get it right \u2014 others will enjoy them as much as I do. \n \n   About Me \n I began my Roblox development journey in 2016, starting \u2014 like many \u2014 by dragging toolbox models into my games and learning by doing. I knew nothing about coding or systems back then, but I was determined to create games I\u2019d actually want to play\u2026 \n \n \nSee more... \n After two years of experimenting with builds and mechanics, I made the jump into scripting and 3D modeling, and everything changed. \n My first real attempt was a survival game called Sailing, where players traveled on rafts, scavenged islands, and tried to survive. While the idea had potential, the execution was hampered by inexperience \u2014 the codebase was full of spaghetti logic, and the project was eventually shelved. But I learned hard lessons about scope, structure, and the importance of planning. \n Next came Factories \u2014 a logistics/resource-management game inspired by Factorio. I implemented a procedural terrain generator and started exploring what I call \u201cmechanical atmosphere\u201d \u2014 immersive environments that reinforce gameplay logic. \n This evolved into a short experimental project called Testing Atmosphere Horror Things, where I focused on tone, lighting, and environmental tension over mechanics. \n In 2020, I wokred on Destination, a PvP survival game focused on looting, craf",

Each time these rays bounce, it checks for line of sight to every sound object that could realistically be heard. If bounce is greater than 1 then it checks for line of sight back to the emitter for echoes. \n If a sound isn\u2019t being hit by any rays then it fires a ray from the emitter to that sound (that could realistically be heard of course) and using the material of the stuff it hits as well as its thickness, it adjusts volume as well as equalizer stuff. \n I\u2019m working on making it a plugin. \n   Other stuff \n I found this  mod  and I just loved it. I also looked at the  framework  this mod was based off of and I was just  inspired.  \n Also thanks for  this  Godot plugin too \n I found out Roblox made a thing like this too late\u2026  Oh well    \n   Media \n \n   \n     \n   \n \n\n               \n \n \n   \n=\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 // Ayt, thanks for reading // \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014=\n    ",
