It seems to happen completely randomly, but more than often enough to disrupt gameplay significantly.

Notably, it prints that the part interacted with is the player’s HumanoidRootPart, regardless of what part they had touched to trigger the long distance team change. I kept track of the HumanoidRootPart’s position, and it is unchanged in this interaction, it just somehow assumes the player touched the SpawnLocation.

Then the align orientation constraint makes its rotation back to by applying torque force. \\nBut as the position of the cylinder was incremented previously, the cylinder is slightly above the ground in the next frame, and in the next next frame it comes down, and this process repeats. \\n Isnt there another approach to this?

Then the align orientation constraint makes its rotation back to by applying torque force. \\nBut as the position of the cylinder was incremented previously, the cylinder is slightly above the ground in the next frame, and in the next next frame it comes down, and this process repeats. \\n Isnt there another approach to this?

For context, here is a pseudocode I came up with that represents the system I have: \\n \\n Every ability will split into two modules: the server side, and client side. \\n The client side ability code runs  immediately  upon input after checking if it can be activated with some client sanity checks, for responsiveness.

Two things can happen here:\\n \\n The server agrees with the client, and nothing happens. \\n The server disagrees with the client, and send back a remote signal to that client and rollback to their previous state \\n \\n \\n Every ability can decide their own cooldowns on both client and servers.

I have a ton of questions, but what I’m most curious about right now is:  \\n 1 - How do they attach the clothes to the specific body parts? (Also curious if the process is any different if the clothes have bones with physics, eg. long sleeves) \\n2 - Should clothes be counted as an accessory? If so, then that means they need attachments, right? \\n3 - Would this work if I have a single-mesh body and a non-R15 rig? Or would it be better to have the custom R15 package? (The body making and importing is a whole another story that I have a lot of questions about, but this is about everything I wanna find out about yet) \\n4 - Another thing I noticed is that some items replace the body parts, how is that possible? Is the body part it replaces invisible and does the item have its own “skin” parts that displays on top of that? \\n5 - I’m also kind of curious about equipping the clothes to the body and how to script a button to do that (not a touch brick). \\n6 - Also curious about assigning animations/poses to items. Mainly because I wanted to make a separate pose for feet so that the pose alters between heels and flat shoes or bare feet without replacing the feet entirely. Would it cause a lot of problems for the animations (Even if I make other non-shoes animations/poses without the feet key frames)? \\n This is my first post so I apologize if this i", "upvotes": 2, "category": "building-support", "comments": 1, "created_at": "2026-01-05T19:15:34.978Z"}

PwXHKU4d-PA	Best BEGINNER GUIDE to Scripting your FIRST Roblox Game!	DeHapy	117152	19:10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwXHKU4d-PA	roblox scripting tutorial	all right guys welcome to my first ever scripting lesson if you've watched my previous content you know that I don't typically do educational stuff but today we're going to be trying it out and see how it goes so today I'm going to be showing you guys how to make a button simulator which is the first game that I made that performed really well and it made like 300,000 Roo in total and this is when I was first starting out so it's possible for any of you guys to do for sure so we're going to start off by opening a new base plate in Roblox studio now before we do any scripting or building anything like that we want to go up into game settings and we want to save this game to Roblox and you guys can name it whatever you want for the sake of this I'm just going to name it button simulator demo if you guys hear some banging in the background that's my dad working downstairs ignore that all right so now that the game has been saved to Roblox we can go ahead and open up game settings once again and now we're going to go into security and we will want to enable the requests along with access to API services and then if you guys plan on adding game passes to your game you will want to allow third party sales then you can go ahead and just save it all all right so the first thing we're going to want to do with this project is add a new script to server script service and if you guys do not see this box on the right side go ahead and click on the top view and then enable explore and properties all right so once we have the script open we're we going to go ahead and change the name to leader stats because this is where we're going to be making the stats for the players so where do we start first we want to define the data so where do we start with this well first we want to detect when a player joins the game so that we can give them their data first we have to Define players so let's do local players equals game get service players so what this does is we created a new value by using the local called players and this is the service within Roblox Studio that is already created and now we're going to detect when a player is added to the game so player. player added connect function player so what this does is we got the players from the line that we did before and we're going to detect when a player is added to that list of players and whenever there is a new player added we're going to connect a function and use player as the value for that player who has just been added so if we ever want to modify something about the player we use this term right here so let's go ahead and make a new folder inside of the player where we'll hold all of the stats so let's go ahead and do local leader stats equals instance. new folder and we'll put it inside the player so what this does is just creates a folder and puts the player as the parent and we'll want to give the name to this value so we'll do leader stats. name equals leader stats next we're going to want to go ahead and add the different values that will be in this folder so we'll do local cache equals instance. new folder or actually we'll want to do a number value for this because we'll be changing the value of this and we'll put it inside of the leader stats folder and then we'll give a name for the cache so cash. name equals cach and then if you want to add any more stats you can go ahead and copy this and just change the name here for whatever you want so we'll do multiplier next since that is a common value in a button simulator and then we'll change the name in here to multiplier and now if we go ahead and click play on the top of the screen we should see our stats in the top right corner like you see in most games so we have a value for cash and a value for multiplier but right now none of the stats are changing so let's go ahead and add in a system to gain cash every few seconds so first we're going to want to make a new script and double click on it to open it and we'll want to say game do player player added so the same thing as before and we'll connect another function and we'll do while wait this number right here is how fast you will generate cash so this is going to be every tenth of a second because I have 0.1 if you put one here it'll be wait for 1 second so I'm going to keep it at like 0.2 probably while wait 0.2 do player. leader stats. cache. Value Plus equals 1 so what this does is we get the leader stats value that we put inside of the player in this leader stats script right here and then we got the cash which was located inside the leader stats which we did here and we got the value of that and added one to it so now every fifth of a second we get some cash and it seems to be working well so far it's amazing that I haven't made an error yet I kind of suck at scripting so now we got the cash increasing and we should probably start making the actual buttons because that's the whole point of the game right so let's go ahead and add in a cylinder and we can scale this up a bit this is all of your preference you could use a model from blender to if you'd like we're going to go ahead and just make a folder in the workspace titled buttons then inside of this we'll make another folder for multiplier buttons and let's go ahead and place this inside of that multiplier folder and we'll name it multiplier and for the sake of consistency we'll make make this red like most games have it so now let's go ahead and add a script inside the buttons folder name this button Handler so first we want to get all the buttons in the game right so we'll do local buttons equals script. parent and then get descendants and what this does is we're getting this buttons folder and we're selecting everything under it next we're going to want to get players once again so local players equals game get service player so now this is where it starts to get a little bit more confusing we're going to do a four Loop so four and then underscore comma button and I pairs buttons do so what this does is basically it runs through each descendant within the buttons and it assigns this name to it and then this underscore is just for each thing inside of the folder so we're running the script for every object inside of this folder so now we obviously don't want this script to apply to the script or to the folder so we're going to say if button. name equals multiplier then and you'll want to put a double equals here actually to make sure that it's true and we can change this name to just multiplier now and we'll actually want this in parentheses or not parentheses quotation marks and to test that we found this we're going to do print button found so let's go ahead and test and see if we have it in the output and yes we do we have printed button found if you guys are not able to see the output go ahead and click view on the top of the screen and select output right here all right we're chilling so far this is going well I'm very impressed with myself so now we want this button to actually do something right so let's go ahead and detect when the player steps on the button so we'll do button. touched connect function hit so whenever the button is touched we're connecting a new function and hit is going to be the value of the thing that touched that button so we're going to see if we want to detect if it's actually a player that touched the button and not just another part so we're going to do if hit. parent find first child of class humanoid then so we're seeing if the thing that hit the button has a humanoid within it and that's going to basically detect if it's a player and then we're going to say local player equals players get player from character hit. parent so we're seeing if they have a humanoid then we're going to say that the person who hit the button is player and we're going to say if player then so we're going to make sure we got the player local cache this is where we're going to change the actual stats of the player's values so local Stat or local cach equals player. leer stats. and local multi equals player. leer stats multi all right all right so we've got this and now we want to change the value right so we're going to say multi. Value Plus equals 1 so this is going to basically do multi equals the same value that it was before but adding one so now whenever we step on the button our multiplier should go up by one oh no oh stupid error by me oh we love getting errors we just have to change this instead of multi it's PL multiplier I got lazy so now it should work yes there we go we got a multiplier every time we step on the button but we want to actually have the player purchase the button instead of just getting free stuff from it right so we're going to go ahead and add a value within this button so let search value we'll do a number value and we're going to name this amount this is going to be how much multiplier the player gets from the button and then we'll make another value called cost and this is how much cash the player is going to have to pay to get the button so we'll name this like 25 cash so now what we have to do is we have to check if the player has enough cash to purchase the button so we're going to do if cash. value is greater than or equal to button. amount then cash. value minus equals button. amount and then we can say rebirth. Value Plus equals button dot okay so this should actually be cost cost then this is multiplier I don't know what I'm thinking so now we have to get at least 25 cash you can see it's not working right now oh I see we have to add a value here so cuz we're checking for the actual number within the button not just the variable so now whenever we have over 25 cash it should work yeah there we go all right see I knew I'd be making errors here soon I'm not I'm not that good at scripting I was surprised that I made it that far now whenever we get multiplier our cash is not going up any quicker and typically what we want is the multiplier multiplies the cash hence the name so let's go back into our Cash Generator script and let's change this to plus equal 1 player. leer stats do multiplier Dov value and we'll put this in parenthesis just to avoid any errors so now when we get one multiplier we should gain two cash each tick there we go yep we gain twice as fast now we gain three four five 6 all right perfect now oh what do we do now we've got the basic system down but we only have it for multiplier buttons right and we can now duplicate this button and just change the values inside of it so let's say like we want five multiplier for 200 cash we can do that now but there's no way of telling the actual cost of the buttons or what it giving cuz there's nothing displaying above the button to show that so let's go ahead and add some billboard UI above the button to do this let's go ahead click on the button and add billboard UI then inside this we'll add a frame so for the billboard UI let's go ahead and adjust the position so search for offset studs offset and you'll want to change this middle value so I'm going to set it to like five and then we'll also want to adjust the size let's let's adjust the size to like 0.5 comma 0.5 and then all right that's very small we can change that for sure let's do like five and then three that's a little big all right that works and then the frame inside will change the size to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma 0 perfect so now let's go ahead and add a text label inside of this Frame we're going to set the Anchor Point to 0.5 comma 0.5 and we'll set the position to 0.5 comma 0 comma 0.25 comma 0 and we'll set the size to 1 comma 0 comma 0.5 comma 0 and we'll change the text to cost or actually we'll we'll change this to amount and we'll change the name of the text label to amount as well then we're going to go ahead and duplicate this by holding contrl D and we'll change the name of this to cost and the position will change the 0.25 to 75 so now we have these two different text labels and for both of these you want the text to be scaled so go ahead and check off this box here all right we're making good progress here so let's go ahead and change the cost text to cost just so we know what each is cost all right all right so now let's go ahead and figure out how to incorporate this into the script so that we can display the cost value and the amount Val value above each of these texts so let's go back into the button Handler script and first off we're going to want to move this button. amount. value and button. Costa value up higher in the script so that we can refer to it earlier so let's go ahead and do it way up here before the buttons even touched we'll do local amount equals button. amount. value and then local cost equals button do cost. value and then we can change each of these to the corresponding value value all right next we can go ahead and do button. billboard ui. amount. text label. text equals amount so what this does if we got all the way down to the text label that we just created oh we don't even need the text label we can just do frame. amount. text so we got billboard UI frame amount and then we get the text of that and we set it to amount and then we'll do button do billboard ui. frame. cost. text equals cost so now when we play we get one multiplier from the button and it costs 25 but it's not pretty obvious to the player what which ones the cost and which ones the amount that you get so let's go ahead and change the colors of these so the text color for the amount is probably going to be red because that is what we are getting from the button the multiplier color is red and then and the cache we'll probably want that to be green oh text color green and that'll make it more obvious so now we see we lose 25 cash and we get one multiplier from it and then also just to make it look better you can go onto the billboard UI and set this light influence all the way to zero when it's at one it'll have a different brightness depending on which way you're facing in relation to the sun but if you set this to zero it'll always just be its brightest and then we can also select each of these frames and just select and set the background transparency to one that way all you see is the text there so now when we play we have a one on top and a 25 on bottom it's looking pretty good so far so now we can go ahead and duplicate this button a few times give it some new values so let's set the amount to like five cost 125 or 150 actually let's do another one let's say we get 10 from this one and and it costs 400 each of these buttons will display their own values now so this one you get one multiplier for 25 cash this one you get five for 150 cash the last one you get 10 for 400 cash pretty simple and you can just do this for as long as you want on an endless line now let's say you want to add in some more values because just having multiplier is a little boring so let's add in a new button we'll name this rebirth and we'll change the color to Blue all right and now let's go ahead and make a new folder inside the buttons folder and we'll name it rebirth perfect so now let's go ahead and change the color on the text to match so we'll change the amount to blue and then cost to Red because we're going to be spending the multiplier to get this button all right so now let's go ahead and add in a new multiplier value into the leader stats so we'll say local rebirth equals instance. new number value number value comma leader stats and then rebirth. name equals rebirth and in this button Handler we're now going to need to change a few things so let's say okay so we have to detect if the button is within the rebirth folder or the multiplier folder so let's do if button. parent. name equals multi then and then we'll move all of this over and then we'll do if button. par. name is equal to rebirth then so then we'll do if if multi. value is greater than or equal to cost then multi. Val gets subtracted by the cost and the rebirth. value is added by one or added by the amount and we haven't defined rebirth yet in this script so let's go ahead and do that local rebirth equals player. leer stats. rebirth and just like that we added a new stat to the game it'll be that simple every time so let's go ahead and play oh we have not set an amount in cost yet for this we're going to go ahead and change this right here on the line five where we check for the button's name we're going to change this to button and we're going to change all of these parts to button just so that we don't have to make a new section for each of the new multipliers button so now it'll go through every button in the game and give them their values so this one will get one rebirth for 25 multiplier so let's go ahead and grind for 25 multiplier all right we have 26 multiplier and now when we step on this we should get one rebirth yes it worked perfect I'm so good at scripting guys I don't know why I ever doubted myself okay so now when we get the rebirth we want to get more multiplier based on how much rebirth we have so let's go ahead and change this spot right here we're going to do we're going to put this into parentheses amount plus rebirth. value okay so now if we save up for more rebirths again we'll get d the amount of multiplier when we get one rebirth so instead of getting one multiplier from this button we'll get two all right so now if we buy Here We step on here you see it goes up by two oh we're getting very quick now this game's getting a little easy might need to make some balance changes but yeah uh that's basically a full button simulator right there obviously it can look prettier but I just speedran this in 30 minutes just to show you guys how to do a little bit of scripting yourselves and yeah if you guys want a better version of this I'll be posting one on shopy happy and I hope you guys all learned something from this anyways I hope you all have a good day thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one	17998	t	This content addresses foundational hurdles for new Roblox developers by providing clear instructions on setting up leaderstats, API services, and player-event scripting for a popular game genre.	{"Roblox scripting for beginners","how to make leaderstats Roblox","Roblox button simulator tutorial","Roblox Studio API services","Lua scripting playeradded","Roblox server script service"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	[{"apis": ["API Services", "Third Party Sales"], "problem": "Enable API services and third-party sales for monetization", "category": "Monetization", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["Players.PlayerAdded", "Instance.new", "NumberValue", "Folder"], "problem": "Create a player leaderboard system (leaderstats)", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["wait", "while loop"], "problem": "Generate currency automatically over time using a loop", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["Cylinder"], "problem": "Create a 3D button mesh for player interaction", "category": "3D Modeling", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}]	Creating a basic Button Simulator game	f	\N	\N

u6I17z6ggUg	Raycasting (Guns, Visualizers, Shapecasts) - Roblox Advanced Scripting #37 (2025)	BrawlDev	67074	46:02	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6I17z6ggUg	roblox scripting tutorial	This is raycasting. A simple to understand idea yet very difficult concept to implement on Roblox. And it has many practical use cases as seen in very popular Roblox games. Think of games like blocks fruits where they have projectile based abilities that use ray casting or games like bedwars to determine what blocks can be destroyed by the players when they click on them. Those only scratched the surface of what you can do with ray casting, but in general, it's one of the most popular Roblox scripting concepts ever. My name is Baldev and in this advanced scripting tutorial episode, we'll be covering what ray casting is and how we can implement this inside of our own Roblox games. And by the end of this video, my goal is to equip you with the knowledge to understand ray casting on a fundamental level and can script ray casting for your own systems. But before we do, let's think about this for a minute. The first thing we want to ask ourselves is what the heck is raycasting and how can we use raycasting inside of our scripts to make really cool systems. So I have this little visual example here and to give you a fundamental definition of what ray casting is, it's the process of sending out an invisible line from a starting point in a specific direction with a defined length. So to help you understand what I'm talking about here, we have this red line here that's going to represent our ray. And we have this blue part here that represents our starting point of this line. And so if we were to take this line and we start it over here, then what we're going to do is we're going to use ray casting to essentially shoot a ray in a specific direction with a defined length. and it's going to try and detect if there's an object that intersects with that line. So, in other words, when we shoot this ray, we cast the ray to the world, hence the name ray casting, and it's just going to shoot a line like this, and it's going to try and detect an object that's in the way of it. And if it does detect an object, then we're going to get information about that object in specific to then do stuff with our scripts. So, it seems pretty cool and all, but how does this actually help us as Roblox developers? Well, let's say for instance, we have a system like uh a turret where if a player walks in front of the turret, then we want to get information about whether this is a player that's standing in front of the turret. And if it is a player, then we want to start firing the turret in this direction. Or let's say we have a gun system where if we shoot in a specific direction, then we want to use ray casting to fire a bullet from the gun to where the player clicked on their mouse. Let's say another use case is if we want to have a placement system where we want to get the player's mouse and we want to locate it with respect to the game's world to be able to place down items inside of the game. That also uses ray casting. There's even things like weapon hit detection. So, if you have like a sword and you want to be able to detect if a player is being hit by your sword's hitbox, then that's another practical use case of raycasting. And it's, as I mentioned before, the list just goes on with ray casting. It's a very widely used concept in Roblox scripting, but it can be challenging to those who have never used raycasting before. And my goal for this video is to teach you the fundamentals of raycasting and how you can use raycasting in your scripts to make really cool systems like this. So with that being said, let's go ahead and go straight into implementing ray casting. Now that we understand it, let's implement ray casting inside Roblox Studio. Now it's as I said earlier in this episode, in order to perform ray casting, we need two pieces of information. One is the starting point, also known as the origin, and the other is the direction that we want to take from that starting point. And an easy way that we can do this is by using a part as the starting point. And then we specify our own direction based off of that starting point. So what we're going to do is go into model and we're going to insert a part. Now with this part, I'm going to scale down just a little bit. I'm going to change the brick color to something different. I'm going to set anchored to true. And I'm also going to rename this part to origin part just like this. Now what we're going to do is go inside of server script service, hit the plus sign, and we're going to insert a script. Now from here we're going to first make reference to our origin part by saying local origin part equals workspace.org part just like this. Now we need to specify a direction. Now this direction can be any vector 3 value that we pick. But let's say from the origin point we want the ray to be 100 studs going this way. So if we were to specify the direction by saying local direction equals vector 3. Uh then what we're going to do is put 100 for the X and then zero for the Y and then zero for the Z. So when we combine our origin part with its direction, the ray is going to look something like this where this is the starting point and then it goes 100 studs this way. So this is what the ray is going to look like when we cast it into the world. Okay. So now that we have our pieces of information, how do we actually cast the ray into the world? Well, we can do this using the workspaces raycast method and we're going to be doing that under a loop by either using a while loop or by using run service. But in this case, we're going to use run service. So at the top here, we're going to make reference to run service by saying local run service equals game get service run service just like this. Now down here we're going to say run service heartbeat colon connect function open close parenthesis enter. Now we're going to use that raycast method that I mentioned before. So, what we're going to do is say workspace colon raycast open and close parenthesis. And this takes in three pieces of information, but right now we're going to be focused on the first two, which is the origin. So, we're going to say origin part.position. And then we're going to throw in the direction as well. So, this casts our array into the world. And this is going to return what's called a raycast result that gives us information about the object that this ray has hit. So we're going to throw this inside of a uh variable by saying local ray result equals and then the workspace raycast method here. So from here we're going to say if ray result then this is basically going to tell us that there was an object that actually hit the ray. So, we're going to say something like something has hit the array. Uh, otherwise, we're just going to say nothing has hit the array or something like that just to tell us information about whether there is an object that was actually in the way of the ray or not. Okay. So, in order for us to tell whether this is actually working, let's insert another part here. I'm just going to make this like a big wall just like this. And what we're going to do is go to test and hit run. And basically inside the output it's going to say that nothing has hit the ray multiple times. So right now the ray looks something like this. And if we were to move this object in the way of the ray then as you can see in the output it says something has hit the ray. And if we move the wall away again then it's going to say nothing has hit the ray. So this is the basic idea behind ray casting. It's to shoot array into the world and it's to give us information about objects that intersect that array. That's the whole idea behind it. Now, you might be wondering what information does this raycast actually return. Well, if we go back into our script and let's say that ray result was successful and we say ray result dot, we can see that there's five pieces of information that ray result does provide to us. The first one is the instance which basically tells us what was the instance that hit the ray. The second one is the exact position as to where the ray and the part hit each other. Uh the third thing is the material of the object that the ray hit. And then we have a normal vector and we also have a distance which tells us how far apart was the ray origin and the point at which both the ray and the object hit. So depending on what you're creating, these pieces of information can be really helpful in terms of what you want to accomplish with ray casting. Okay. So before we move on, I want to help you visualize these rays that we're creating by using a function that basically shows us what these rays look like so that we're not working with invisible rays throughout this entire episode. And so basically what I did was I created this function here called visualize ray that takes in two parameters. One is the origin and the other is the direction. So if we open this up, basically what's happening here is we're creating a new part. We're setting some properties and we're setting the parent of this to workspace and we're using debris to automatically get rid of this part after 0.5 seconds. Now what we need to do to complete this function is by defining some variables and by changing the size and the C frame of this part to accurately reflect on what the rays will look like and where it's placed. So we need two pieces of information which I'm going to explain what these are in just a little bit. But we need to define the length and the midpoint. So what we're going to do is say local length equals direction domagnitude just like this. And then we're going to define the midpoint by saying local midpoint equals origin plus direction* 0.5. So length is what's used to tell us how big we want this laser to be. And then midpoint is what's going to tell us where we want to position this ray that we create. Now the reason we want midpoint rather than let's say starting this laser at where the origin is is let's say we had a laser that looked like this. So we positioned this laser to be where the origin is. But if we were to change the size of this to make it look like this, then obviously this isn't where we want the laser to be. Instead, we want the laser to be like this instead because this reflects our ray more accurately than what I was showing you just a second ago. And in order for us to get this accurate position, we need to take the origin and the direction. So this is the origin and this is the direction. And we want to get half of that which is in the center here. This is the midpoint and this is the the the exact position that we want when we're trying to cast this ray into the world and by visually showing this as well. So that's what I'm trying to show with both the length and the midpoint. And now we can change the size in the C frame with these pieces of information. So what we're going to do is say new part do size equals vector 3 new. We can set X and Y to be a really small number like 0.1 and 0.1. And then for Z, we're just simply going to throw in the length just like this. And now what we're going to do is say new part. Cframe equals Cframe new. And then inside of here, we're going to start it at the midpoint. So it's going to start right here in the center. And for the look vector, we're going to say origin plus direction just like this. And this is all that we need to do for our visualize ray function. So now what we can do down here is inside of our heartbeat loop. As soon as we get the ray result, we're going to say visualize ray and then we're going to pass in the origin part.position and then we're going to throw in the direction just like this. And this is our visualize ray function that's going to be helpful for us. So if we go into the game, I'm just going to delete this origin part. And if we hit run, then what we should see is now we have a visual array that we can look at to really see what is actually happening inside the workspace. So, if I were to move this part in front of the ray, then what it's going to do is it's going to say that something has hit the ray. And if we lift it back out, then it's going to say nothing has hit the ray. And so, this is what we're going to be using for the rest of this episode to really help us visualize what these lasers are going to look like. Okay. So, right now, we have a one-part raycast system where we have a part that acts as the origin point and then we have a direction that tells us how far do we want this ray to shoot out. So, it looks something like this currently. And we can move this starting point around to adjust where the ray is inside the world. But what if we wanted to create a two-part system where we have a starting point that's going to be a part and then we have an ending point or a goal that's also going to act as a part. So it's a two-way system where if we change the goal or the starting point, then it's going to affect how the raycast is displayed in the world. We can do that really quickly if we hit stop. And what I'm going to do is duplicate this origin part, move it over here. Uh I'm going to rename this to goal part. And I'm going to change the brick color this to something like yellow. So if we go inside of our script, what we're going to do is first make reference to the goal part by saying local goalpart equals workspace.galpart. And then what we're going to do here is we need to specify the direction based off of the goal parts position and the origin parts position. So, I'm going to comment out this direction definition up here, and I'm going to move it down here by saying local direction equals goalpart.position minus origin part.position. And then we're going to use this new direction to define our ray inside of the world. So if we now hit run, then what's going to happen is we're going to use ray casting to shoot array from the origin point and to the destination as well. And if we were to change either of these parts, then as you can see, the raycast is being updated to reflect on these new positional changes either on the goal or at the origin. So, this is pretty cool if you know the destination plus the origin so that you can create raycasts into the world that reflect on both of these parts just like this. Now, you might notice something. It says down here in the output that something has hit the ray and it keeps displaying this for some reason. There isn't anything blocking it. So, what's the problem here? Well, the problem here lies in how we specified that any object whatsoever, it doesn't matter what object it is, it is going to detect anything that's in the way of this ray. And what is this part? Well, the part that this ray is intersecting is this goal part right here. But what if we don't want this goal part to be part of the raycast detection? Well, this is a perfect transition into what we're going to be talking about next, which is called raycast parameters. So, raycasting has this cool feature that allows us to choose which specific instances can either be included or not be included in the list of instances that can be intersected with the rays that we shoot into the world. So, how this can be useful is with the example I just explained earlier and how we have a starting point, which is this part right here. So, we shoot the ray starting from here and then it goes into the goal part. But on the output, it's been saying that something has hit the ray even though nothing is actually in between these two points. And that's because it's detecting this goal part right here, which we don't want to include in the list. So, in order to handle situations like this, we're going to create what are called raycast parameters and add this goal part to the list of instances that are not allowed to be intersected with the ray. So let's go to our script so that we can make this change. And what we're going to do is create raycast parameters by saying local raycast params equals raycast params new open and close parenthesis. And now inside of here we're going to say raycast params dot filter descendant instances equals open and closed curly braces. And this is the table of all the instances that we don't want to include in the list or instances that we do want to include. So in this case, we're going to say goalpart here as the only instance in the list. And then we're going to say raycast params dot filter type equals enum dot raycast filter type dot. And then we have two options with either excluding or including whatever is inside of this list. But for this example, we're going to say exclude because we don't want to include this goal part as one of the instances that can be detected by this array. And finally, what we're going to do is we're going to throw in a third argument inside of our raycast method. And we're just simply going to pass in the raycast params just like that. So now if we go into the game and hit run, what we should see in the output is now nothing is hitting the ray, even though it technically is hitting this goal part, but we chose to ignore this goal part with this ray that's being fired. And if we move the wall over to here, then it's going to say that something has hit the ray, just like so. And if I lift it back out, then it's going to say that nothing is hitting the ray again. So raycast parameters are very useful if we don't want specific instances to be intersected with the rays or if we want only a specific number of instances to be intersected with the rays and we just ignore everything else. Okay, so with what we know, let's create a gun system using ray casting. And I want you to follow exactly what I do as we create the system. And the first thing we need to do is create the gun itself. So what we're going to do is go to model and we're going to hit part. Now, with this part, I'm going to scale it down just like this. Scale it up like this. And I'm going to rename this part to handle. And I'm going to go down here and turn off can collide. Then I'm going to hit the plus sign inside of workspace, insert a tool. I'm going to rename this tool to gun. And I'm going to put the handle inside of this gun, just like this. Next thing I'm going to do is duplicate the handle, scale it down, and move it to the right like this. And I'm going to rename this to part. And then I'm going to duplicate it one more time, move it over here, and call this the point, which is going to be where our bullets are going to be fired from. So to indicate this, I'm just going to change the brick color to, let's say, black. And now we have our gun. But we need to attach all these parts together so that they don't fly off when we u actually use it in the game. So we're going to use weld constraints by hitting the plus sign inside a part, inserting a weld constraint. We're going to set part zero to the part and then part one to the handle. And then I'm going to copy this weld constraint, put it inside a point, and I'm going to change part zero to be the point instead. And now everything should be connected together. But I want you to be careful because depending on how you design this, when you hold the gun, it's probably not going to be oriented correctly. And I'm going to show you a neat trick that you can use to check to see if you're facing the model correctly based on how you're designing it. So, with this handle, what we're going to do is we're going to right click on this handle, and there should be this option called show orientation indicator. And there's this little arrow here that shows you where the front-facing side of the handle is. And so, now all we need to do is just move these parts over here so that we can orient them correctly, just like this. So, I'm just going to right click on this and then hide orientation indicator. And if we now move the gun to starter pack and if we hit test and hit play, then what we should see is when we use our gun, then it should be oriented correctly. And now we have a gun for the player to use. So that's how you create the gun. And now we need to create the functionality of the gun. So we need three things with this gun. And before I do, I'm just going to take the part and the point and put it inside the handle just to make it more organized. So we need three things. We're going to hit the plus sign inside of gun. We're going to insert a script. We're going to insert a local script. And we're going to insert a remote event. So, with all of these three things, what we need to do essentially is make it so that when the player clicks their mouse on a specific direction, then we want to send that information to the server so that we can create a ray that will shoot out from the point of the gun to the direction of where the mouse is. And that's the whole idea behind this gun. uh while we use raycasting. So I'm going to rename this remote event to fire gun. And inside of our local script, we're going to make reference to the tool by saying local tool equals script.parent. Then we're going to say local fire gun equals tool colon waitfor gun just like this. And what I'm also going to do is say local player equals game.players.local player. And then we're going to get the player's mouse. So, we're going to say local mouse equals player colon get mouse open and close parenthesis just like this. And now what we're going to do is say tool.activated col connect function open close parenthesis enter. We're simply just going to say fire gun colon fire server open close parenthesis. And there's two pieces of information that we need. So we need the origin point and we also need the direction which we specified before with raycasting. And basically what we need is the point part. So we're going to say local point part equals tool colon wait for child handle colon wait for child point just like this. So we're going to say point part.position. This is going to be our origin. And then we're going to say mouse.h hit.position which is basically the position of where the player fired their mouse. So now we're done with the local script. So, if we go into our normal script, I'm just going to copy the tool reference and just put it inside of here. What we're also going to do is make reference to the fire gun remote event by saying local fire gun equals tool. Fire gun just like this. Then we're going to say fire gun onserver event connect function open close parenthesis. So, there's three pieces of information here. There's the player, there's the origin, and then there's the mouse position. So with these three pieces of information we can now start creating raycasts on the server side. So the first thing that we need to do is calculate the direction which is basically let's imagine that this is the origin point like this is the point part and we want to make it so that we get the direction from where the mouse position was versus where the origin point was which is always going to be the point part. So if we were to let's say calculate it, it would look something like this. This is the result that we're trying to get. And the way we can do this is we just simply uh subtract the mouse position with the origin position, get a unit vector of it so that it looks something like this, and then multiply it by some sort of scaler, which shows us how far we can shoot the gun, which let's say in this case is 50 studs. It's going to look something like that. So we want to be able to calculate that inside of our script. So if we go back to our script, we can say local direction equals open close parenthesis mouse position minus origin dot unit times and then we can say however many studs we want. We can say 50. Now that I think about it, we can actually just create a uh variable here by saying local distance multiplier just like this. And then we can say something like 50 just so that we can make it adjustable later if we want to. So, now that we have that, we can go to our original script that we used earlier in this tutorial guide and we can just copy the same raycast parameters here because when we're going to be firing our gun, there are certain things that we don't want to intersect with the ray. So, we're going to go to our original script, copy this, and then paste it inside of here. Now, for the filter instances, what we can do is create a variable here called local excluded parts equals open and close parenthesis. And then we can just replace that with this. And now what we're going to do is we're going to use the raycast method by saying local ray result equals workspace colon raycast. And then we're going to throw in the origin the direction and then the raycast params just like that. And we're going to check if the result was successful. So we're going to say if ray result then we're going to say we have found something. So, result has been found. And then we're just going to print the ray result for testing reasons. And then what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our original script and we're literally going to copy the exact same visualize ray function and we're just going to paste it inside of here. Just like this. Except one thing we can do is probably change the color of this to let's say orange. And what we're going to do here is we're going to say visualize ray origin direction. Just like that. So what do we want this ray to actually do? Well, we can do a couple things. Uh, one thing is we can change the color of the instance that the bullet has hit to a different color. So what we can do is say ray results do instance.color equals color3.RGB. And then we can change this to orange. And if this ray was not successful, then what we're going to do is we're just simply going to say result not found. And then we can do the same thing with the visualize ray function. We're just going to put that here as well. Okay. So now if we go into the game, hit test, and hit play, then what we should see with this gun is if we were to fire it at a certain direction, then it's going to shoot a ray from the origin point, and then it's going to fire off in the direction of the player's mouse. And it's going to tell us if a result has been found or if a result has not been found. So if we were to shoot this wall, then it did find an instance and it changed the color of that instance to the color that we specified inside of the script. And we can do this with basically any instance that this has detected. And so that is uh something that we can do with this gun. But let's add another functionality. Let's make it so that if this gun detects a player, then we want that player to take damage. And we can do that inside of here by first locating the character. So we're going to say local character equals array result.instance colon find first ancestor of class open and close parentheses model. And the reason we say it like this is because a player's character is a model. And if we find the first ancestor of a specific instance, which is likely going to be the player's body part, like its arm or its torso or anything like that, then we're going to see if this is an actual character based off of that information. So then if we do find the character then we're going to try to find the humanoid. So we're going to say local humanoid equals character find first child of class and then we're going to say humanoid. So if the humanoid does exist then we're just simply going to say humanoid colon take damage and then we're going to specify like a damage amount like five or something. We can even set that here as well. So local damage equals five. And then we can just replace that with this damage. And I meant to say humanoid here. Okay. So now we can test this even further. If we go to avatar and we click on rig builder, we could just select any rig. I'm just going to say block avatar. And if we now go into test and hit play, then we can test out this gun by firing it at the NPC. And as you can see, it's taking five bits of damage every single time. And that's the result that we wanted to achieve from this. Now, this is a simplified way of creating a gun system using ray casting. But I hope you've been able to learn something from using ray casting to create this gun system that we just created. Okay, so one thing I forgot to do was add to our excluded parts table. Now you might be wondering what should we add to the excluded parts table? Well, there's two important things. So what we're going to do is say table.insert and then for excluded parts, we're going to include the player.c character. And the reason we want to do this is because we don't want to make sure that we hurt ourselves when we fire the ray. And also another thing is over here in our visualize array function, we want to make sure that we add the ray itself into the excluded parts because we don't want the part to be able to interact with each other when we shoot multiple rays at the same time. So we're just going to copy the same uh thing here and paste inside of here, but instead we're just going to add new part instead to our visualize rate function. So, I wanted to clear that up to make this gun system even better that actually uses the raycast parameters. Hey, post edit broad here. So, it turns out there's actually a few mistakes that I made with the raycasting gun script that we just created. And I just wanted to quickly address what these problems are and how we can create a fixed version for this because the script that we have right now technically works, but there are a few issues with it that can make this problematic. And so, I just want to quickly address them. So if we go inside of our scripts, there are two problems here. Uh one is we're using excluded parts as a global table which can actually cause memory leaks based on the way that we've implemented this. And another problem is if we scroll down here, we can see that raycast is being fired before the visualize ray method. Now you might be thinking why is this a problem? Well, if we go inside of the visualize array method over here, uh we're using table.insert insert to insert this new array that we shoot and put it inside of the excluded parts table. Now, the reason we do this is because we want to add all of these rays as filters for raycast parameters so that when we fire the bullets, the other visualized bullets are not going to be included with the ray casting, which is the whole point behind this. But if you still don't see the problem, basically when we fire raycast, we want to take into consideration all the excluded parts that are in here. But if we're adding these new parts to excluded parts after the raycast has already been fired, then there's no point of doing it because the raycast method has already been fired. So we actually need to fire visualize ray before the raycast method over here. So those are some issues that we need to change. And one thing that I want to mention with the whole memory leakage thing is when we use debris to get rid of these new parts, the references to these parts inside of excluded parts are still inside the table, which is why it can accumulate over time and create a memory leakage. So if I were to show you what I'm talking about, I'm just going to write a print statement and I'm going to print the number of items that are inside of excluded parts. So if I fire with my gun, then as you can see in the output, the number that's being displayed is the number of entries that are inside of excluded parts. And as you can see, it's not going away because the rays disappear, but the references to those rays inside of excluded parts are still inside the table. And if we keep firing this, then this is just going to accumulate more and more over time, which is not good. Which is why we need to fix this as one of the problems. And I hope that this part is making sense so far. Okay, so I created a fixed version of the gun ray casting script. Um, so if we go inside of here, then uh I I basically commented out all the parts that we don't need anymore. So this global reference to excluded parts is no longer here because we moved it down here every single time the player fires the gun. So we create a new excluded parts table every single time. And another thing that I changed was this visualize array function is now being fired before the raycast uh method. So if we go inside of visualize array, the things that I've changed here are a few things. So instead of setting the parent of the bullet inside of workspace, we're instead putting it inside of what's called a visualization folder. So this is a little folder that I created called bullet visuals and it's stored inside of the workspace. So, it's basically this bullet visuals folder right here. So, if I were to fire my gun, then all the bullets are being stored inside of this one folder. And the reason it's like this is because this makes it a lot easier for us to keep track of all the bullets that are going to be included in the raycast parameters so that we don't include them when we're firing the bullets uh inside the game. So, we also got rid of the debris method and instead what we're going to do is simply return the new part and and have it be a variable here called visual part so that we can use it inside of this part of the script. So, with excluded parts, we want to include the player's character and we want to also include everything that's inside the visualization folder with all the bullets. So, another thing is I also got rid of all the visualize array methods over here. And I also completely got rid of this else uh branch in this if statement right here because we don't really need it. And at the very end here, I added the game debris add item method and I just got rid of the visual part after 0.5 seconds. So, this is basically how we create a more robust raycast gun script that not only prevents memory leaks from happening because we're creating an excluded parts table every single time the player fires the gun instead of having it be global, but also this is a more appropriate way of using raycast parameters because now this raycast is actually taking into consideration the new bullet visual that has been created inside the game before we fire the raycast method. So, I just wanted to quickly address this because if I left the current script as is, then you probably would have been misusing the raycast methods inside of this video and I did not want that. So, I just wanted to quickly address it. And if you still are watching up until this point, then I really appreciate it a lot. I do put in a lot of time into the scripting tutorials, and there's not that much left on this episode. So, I want you to keep in mind as you follow through the rest of this video is that I'm still going to be misusing the raycast parameters. So, I just want you to keep an open mind as you follow through the rest of this episode. That is all for me. Thank you so much. Now, you might be asking yourself, is it possible to change the shape or the size of these rays? Because theoretically, ray casting is when you shoot a very tiny thin invisible ray uh inside the world. But if we wanted to utilize the functionality of ray casting, but instead using different shapes and different sizes, then it actually is possible. We can use things like block casting, shape casting, and sphere casting that can make bullets that look something like this. So we can use things like cylinders with different sizes. And we can even use things like blocks to achieve the same effect, but instead have like a bigger volume. So that's the definition of these shape casts and block casts and things like that. It's basically ray casting, but if it had volume. And so I think this is something really important to understand when you're utilizing this inside of your Roblox games. And we're just simply going to take our existing gun script and we're just going to modify it to use these casts instead of ray casting. So let's go ahead and go do that right now. Okay. So, we're going to modify our current gun system to use sphere casting to increase the size of our bullets. And basically what we're going to do is we're going to go to our script and inside of our remote event, we're just going to change two things. The first thing is instead of firing raycast, we're going to fire sphere cast instead. And this takes in four parameters instead of three. So we still have the origin, the direction, and the raycast parameters, but as part of the second parameter, this is taking what's called a radius, which determines the radius of the spherical shape in studs. So we can set this to be a number like two. But we can also just create a variable up here by saying local bullet uh radius equals 2. And then we can just replace this two with the variable we just created. Next thing we're going to change is instead of visualize ray, we're going to create our own function for visualizing the shape because we're not visualizing array anymore. We're visualizing a shape. So we're going to create a new function up here by saying local function visualize shape and then it's going to take in the origin, the direction, but this is also going to take the ray result as well. And this is what we're going to be calling instead. So, we're going to say visualize shape origin direction and then the ray results just like that. And I'm also going to copy that and paste it down here as well. Okay. So, here's how this is going to work. We're going to create a visual bullet inside of Studio and we're going to clone that bullet and shape it so that it's going to match where the player is going to be firing. And we're also going to adjust the size of it as well. So, what we're going to do is go to model, hit part, and we're going to create a cylinder, and we're going to rename this to bullet, and then we're going to change the brick color of this to, let's say, orange. And we're going to change the material of this to, let's say, neon. I'm going to set can collide off, and I'm going to turn on anchored, just like this. Okay. So now that we have this bullet, I'm going to throw this inside of server storage. And we're going to make reference to this bullet inside of our script by saying local bullet equals game.server storage dot bullet. Just like that. So now what we're going to do inside of visualize shape is we're just simply going to clone the bullet. So we're going to say local new bullet equals bullet colon clone. And then we're going to set the parent of this new bullet. So new bullet.parent equals workspace. And then we're going to use table.insertexcluded parts and then new bullet just so that the bullets are not going to be interacting with each other. And then we're going to say game. debris colon add item new bullet. And then we're going to get rid of it after 0.5 seconds. Just like this. Okay. So what's left to do here is we need to make a couple calculations so that we can be able to change the size and the C frame of this bullet accurately. Okay. So we need to calculate a few things before we continue. So the first thing is the position of the end result or the position of the goal if that makes sense. So basically what I'm trying to say is that we either hit something with the ray that we shot and we're just going to get the position of that or if we don't hit anything then we're just simply going to get the origin plus direction. That's going to give us the information about the position. Another thing we need to calculate is with that position and with the origin point, we want to be able to get the distance between them as well because that's going to be useful for us to know the size of the bullet. And we also want to get the midpoint so that we know where to position the bullet when we shoot it out into the world. So, if we go inside of our script, uh we're going to calculate these three things on top of here. So we're first going to say local position equals and this can either be one of two values. So we're going to say if ray result then so if uh if we actually did get a result from shooting the ray then we're just simply going to say ray results.position. Otherwise we're just going to calculate the origin plus the direction just like this. Next thing we're going to do is calculate the distance. So we're going to say local distance equals open and close parenthesis. We're going to take the position we just calculated. We're going to subtract that from the origin, so where the the gun was shot from. And then we're going to say dot magnitude because we just want the distance. Like we want a fixed number that's going to be telling us the distance. And then the midpoint, which is literally the exact same calculation as we did in visualize ray. So I'm just going to copy and paste that into here. Okay. So now that we have this, let's change the size and frame of this. So with this bullet, this bullet is a cylinder. So we need to figure out a way to make this cylinder work with its size and also its C frame. And I'm going to show you what that looks like here. So we're going to say new bullet do size equals vector 3. And inside of here, we want the X to be the distance. So if we were to fire from the origin over to that wall over there, then the X is just going to be the distance. So for the Y and Z, these two are going to be the same numbers because it's going to be a perfect symmetrical sphere that looks like this. And if you have taken geometry, basically a radius is like half of a circle if you were to determine the distance from the midpoint to one of the outer edges of the circle. So if we want a full circle, we want the diameter, which in this case that's what it's called, which is basically the bullet radius* 2. And for the Z, it's going to be the exact same thing here as well. So this is how we calculate the size for the new bullet. And now what we're going to do is change the C frame of it. So we're going to say new bullet.cframe equals CF frame.look at or you can use Cframe new. It's up to you. We're going to start this at the midpoint. So, this is the location of where this new bolt's going to be. And then we want it to look at the position. So, we want to make it look at the result of the array. Or if it didn't find a result, then it's just going to get the origin plus direction, and that's where it's going to be facing. Okay. But here's the problem, though. So, right now, if we go inside the game, hit test, and hit play. And if we were to try and fire this right now. So what this is going to do is as you can see the bullet is not oriented correctly. But you can see that the size of our bullet is a lot bigger now because we're using sphere casting instead of ray casting. But we just simply want to orient this in a way so that we can actually make the bullet fire from the point to the direction that it's trying to hit. And what we can do is just simply change the orientation of it. So if we go inside of our script, we're just going to multiply this by Cframe. And this takes in three parameters which are all in radians. So we want to change the yaxis specifically. So the x is going to be zero. And then the y is going to be the thing that we're going to change. And then z is just going to be zero as well. So for the y, because this takes in radians and not degrees, we're going to say math.rad open close parenthesis. And we just want to flip this 90°. And that is all that we need to do for this part. So now we're basically done. If we hit play, then what we should see is if we take our gun and we shoot it in a specific direction, then you can see that the bullet is now a lot bigger and we have more range with the bullet. We have a much bigger hitbox because we're using sphere casts rather than ray casting. And I think this is a really useful way of using sphere casts. But of course, there's many practical use cases that you can use with sphere casting and ray casting as a whole. And I hope that the takeaway from this video is you learned a lot about how ray casting works and how to incorporate ray casting inside of your scripts. And this is definitely one of the most fun episodes that I've been able to work on on the channel. And I apologize that it took me a really long time to actually get to this episode. I really wanted to save this episode for one of the last ones just because I think it's really cool just to learn this stuff. It's as I said in the beginning of this episode, raycasting has a wide range of practical use cases that I will not be able to cover inside of one single tutorial episode. So, my hope for this video is that since you've watched all the way through till the end of this really long video, I know that you're definitely dedicated to learning about raycasting and being able to use what you learned from this video and incorporate them inside your scripts or your systems that you're going to be creating for the future. And I can say with confidence that you can definitely use what you learned from this video and incorporate inside your scripts. It just takes a little bit of practice and a little bit of trial and error, but I think you definitely got this. There were a couple things that I left out from this tutorial, otherwise it would have just been too long. Like debunking my turret system that I showed you in the beginning of this episode that is more on the advanced side. And I decided that I'm going to make that a individual video that's going to be over on my Patreon page. So, if you want to support the work that I do and you love the content that I put out, then I will leave a link to my Patreon page in the description if you want to get access to my scripts and also some occasional bonus content that I might put out over there as well. I would also like to give a shout out to my Patreon members for their continued support. Their support has really been helping me continue making the videos that I've been putting out, and I can't appreciate them more than enough. Please share this video with anyone that you think might be interested in learning about raycasting just to get the word around and to help boost this video into the algorithm by also doing things like leaving a like on this video and leaving a comment as well. You can literally comment about anything. Just anything that can help boost this video into the YouTube algorithm. That would be really appreciative. Like I do spend a lot of hours researching each and every one of these videos to try to make them as high quality as they can be for you guys to to really learn these scripting concepts. and I'm really appreciative of you for sticking around this long in the advanced scripting tutorial guide and what we've been able to accomplish throughout this entire journey and I'm really thankful for that. So that is going to be it for this episode on raycasting. I hope you enjoyed this episode and you learned a lot from it and I will see you in the next one.

33XdKs9u4oE	The Only Thing You Need To Learn How To Script	Ludius	308593	4:36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33XdKs9u4oE	roblox scripting tutorial	there are a lot of scripting tutorials on YouTube however did you know that there's actually something better than video tutorials to learn how to script I'll be revealing what it is in this video so stick till the end real game development is something that requires different skills to create a game you need Builders modelers animators VFX artists someone to do the sounds and also the skill that I picked scripting if you don't know what scripting is put simply scripting is just coding the different systems for your different mechanics of your game basically it makes the game work as you intend it to work and it games that make in reactable and engaging I'll be explaining how I learned how to script and what content or what things I used to learn and it really just boils down to two major things in order for you to understand let me tell you a quick story it's 2020 I'm sitting down in my room using my computer and I've just decided I'm going to learn how to script because I have this game idea I want to make it was like a magico RPG but there's just one problem there's an endless amount of information about this on the internet and YouTube and the first issue that I had and that a lot of developers could very easily have especially if you're new is that you lose a lot of time because you're just trying to pick what content to consume to properly learn so there I was clicking video after video how to make this how to make that tutorials on this tutorials on that and maybe I'm just brain dead but this really made me lose at least one month worth of time I will start a subcription tutorial playlist but that one would be too old so I'd move into another one but the dude on this one just rushes The tutorials this one I can barely understand and speak this other one the D doesn't even speak at all eventually I came across a channel called the death ging while searching for scripting tutorial playlist I tried his series and for me it was the best I could have for at the time I went to take a look at his playlist and I saw that at the time it was pretty much the most complete developed and updated playlist on how to script and so what do I do I just followed his tutorials and replicated absolutely everything on his tutorials now I'm not going to lie I'm not going to sit here and say it was easy it was really taxing and I'd be almost every day almost all day just watching videos and replicating sometimes re-watching and going through the process again to make sure I'd learned things that I felt would be really important and this is how I got my base for scripting I just followed all the Death Kings tutorials on scripting I spent like 4 to 6 months on this but a long time you might say but I think it was worth it to spend that long on that but it doesn't really stop here I got a very good base here but there's another very important piece of content that really solidified my bases and also gave me a little bit more of practical examples for scripting with a the P I'm about to mention I think it would have taken at least four to six more months to exit the baby death stage what I'm talking about is the book by Heath H Haskins the advanced Ro book coding book now almost every person that told to get this book doesn't end up getting this book and they really don't know how much available insight and information they're missing out on as soon as you watch a decent scripting Basics playlist you should get a copy of this book and read it thoroughly honestly scratch another YouTube scripting tutorial Series this book will not only solidify your basis it will also give you practical examples for your scripting which is also extremely important when you're trying to learn and the best part is that he will explain it in a way that you will be able able to easily Implement them I know the book says Advanced but honestly you don't need to be an advanced scripture to find volue in this book I'm telling you read this book man or you're going to miss out on so many valuable insights and information that you'll regret not reading it in the future my only regret with this book is not reading it earlier actually I have a physical copy of the book and I quickly went through it just for the video and since you made it this far into the video I'll let you know this you don't need any playist to learn how to script you just need the book The Advanced Roblox coding book if you're going to take one thing from this video is that you need to get that book as soon as possible ASAP the book covers literally everything and it explains it to you in a very simple way it explains the basics of Roblox Studio coding and also some more advanced stuff that you'll be able to understand if you just go through the book in Order yeah it's that good I do want to clarify I'm not associated at all with this book I wish I was though there's literally no affiliate link no nothing you can search it on Amazon and just get a copy of it I'm just being fully transparent here this book is the only thing you'll really need if you want to learn how to script and so many people sleep on this don't sleep on it get that book if you want to learn how to script that's what I have for today man I really do hope you get that book and don't be like every other person who have recommended this book too it's only 15 bucks on Amazon and trust me it's worth every single penny well

eB1U5QF1RlM	Delta Executor - RUN Scripts iOS & Android Tutorial for Roblox Script - Delta Executor UPDATE	Noah and the Whale 	13228	5:04	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB1U5QF1RlM	roblox scripting tutorial	Delta Exeutor is there waiting for us to be used just like never before. Roblox will not be the same guys. You will be mind. You can play any game with any script, not literally any script. They have specific scripts for specific games, but basically you can choose from it guys on the homepage where you can enter the scripts executed from here guys. Hello YouTube. Welcome back. Let me blow your mind away just by showing you how you can get the only working Delta Exeutor for Roblox that can be applied for both iOS and Android devices. And your boy doesn't want to waste your time. Let me jump straight into action guys on my iOS device. So later on on my Android device, I will show you all how the Delta Executor looks like, what you can do with it, guys, and just be mind blown. Simple as that. So without further ado, make sure to have your Wi-Fi connection on. Do not use any type of VPN connections. That being said, that being done, open up your browser. Doesn't matter which one. What only matters right here is to type in this address and this address only. As soon as we're here, guys, you can see just at the very start, you have the Delta Exeutor. Also, you can get some scripts from here and even get some Robux. But let's not lose our focus. Let's go ahead and get that Delta Exeutor up and running for us. as your boy already has it on Android device as already mentioned. Guys, I'm so excited to share this whole thing with you guys and just enjoy playing Roblox from now on. So guys, you need to enter your Robux ID right here. If you don't know it, go to this website, enter your nickname on Roblox, click on that character as soon as it pops up, copy that whole link, paste it right here. It will extract your your exact Robux ID that you have. Click on the search button and let's continue further to the next step guys where we will be selecting a script. So your boy will select the script that goes with 99 nights in the forest and that will be for trap. So each and every script from here guys is for a specific game. Forge trap will be appliable for almost 10 games on Roblox as I think I think that it it is a 10 number game. So basically it is several games for it. Bloxs foods 99 nights even more. So you can check it out that all out on Google or something. And now guys, just make sure to tap on this little button right here. So we will now be uh redirected to the final step of this whole process where you need to either complete three questions by answering some simple questions and that will be a faster alternative for you guys. Or you can do it just like your boy did by downloading three apps which are from the official apps or Google Play Store. not only download them but also do what it says from you in the description. For example, you can see for Tik Tok for example, install open and run for 30 seconds, install plus search for Oprah GX and so on and on. So guys, let me download the three apps that I've downloaded on my Android device and guide you further. Okay, fellas. So you can see right here that your boy has downloaded those three apps on my Android device also. You will see it in a very bit. So, what you need to do is go ahead and download app number one, which was in my case Just Play. Then go ahead and download app number two, which was in my case Oprah GX, and then download app number three, Tik Tok. So, for Just Play, you needed to download it and play two games for 10 minutes each. For Oprah GX and Soul Plus, search something, anything literally. And for Tik Tok, only open it up for 30 seconds. So, as mentioned, I already got it all on my Android device. So, I just wanted to make sure to show it on another device so I don't mix anything up, guys. And basically, you can see the apps right here. And let me open up 99 Nights in the Forest. And let me show you what you can do with the Delta Executor. How cool it is, guys. Let me click on the play button. Let me join up some world nice and quickly right here. Okay, like that. Let me just join up and create a single group, single party size group. And right after that, guys, you can already see it on the right side. The Delta Exeutor is there waiting for us to be used just like never before. Robux will not be the same guys. You will be mindful. You can play any game with any, not literally any script. They have specific scripts for specific games. But basically you can choose from it guys on the homepage where you can enter the scripts executed from here guys. Also the welcoming page where you can join up some telegram discord group even search scripts from here but this is the more efficient way to add them guys. There will be the specific scripts for it and also some settings right here guys which you can use. And let me just exit it from that button. You can access it from this button later on, guys, and just enjoy playing your favorite games on Roblox. Whether it's 99 Nights in the Forest, still a brain rod, Forsaken, you name it, they have the script for it. Guys, thank you so much for watching. I hope everything was useful. If not, leave a comment down below. Yurbo will be there for you. Otherwise, see you in the next one. Bye.	5185	f	The content promotes a third-party script executor using 'human verification' offer walls, which is generally categorized as low-quality or deceptive content and does not serve legitimate Roblox developers.	{"Delta Executor","Roblox script executor","Roblox exploits iOS Android","Roblox mobile scripts","how to run scripts on Roblox"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N

F3ASTJuO82A	How PRO Devs Set Up Roblox Games	Leif	109792	11:08	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3ASTJuO82A	roblox scripting tutorial	Roblox projects fall apart as they grow, not because of bad code, but because of that structure. This video breaks down how professional developers set up their games with organized folders, modular services, scalable UI, and essential packages. This isn't just for big teams. This is the exact structure that I use, and I'm going to walk you through it step by step. Advanced tooling like VS Code and Rojo aren't required, but if you want to dive deeper into tooling, you should check out my previous tutorial video. Let's break down the structure behind the professional-grade Roblox game. Game logic should be broken into services. Each service owns a slice of your game and manages related data and systems. For example, build service would handle placement of parts, while enemy service controls enemy spawning and tracking. Although not always required, each service is typically split into client and server versions with shared functionality or data placed in a utility module. This keeps your logic organized, makes debugging easier, and helps your game scale cleanly as it grows. So, what does this actually look like in Studio? First, we're going to create a shared folder. This will house our shared and client game logic. Inside of shared, create a services folder. Each service will have a dedicated folder assigned to it for easy scalability. In this example, I will create a build service. The client version of each service will live here along with any needed shared utility scripts. We must place the server versions of each service under server script service in order to prevent exploiters from downloading sensitive server code. Our build services hierarchy setup is now complete. Here's an example with multiple services. Like I mentioned earlier, some services don't need client and server versions as you can see with part service here. Ideally, all related code would live together for easy access and navigation. However, the server code must stay within non-replicated containers as mentioned earlier. To remedy this, I created a VS Code tool that automatically maps scripts to their correct container while allowing everything to live together. This tool is available on my GitHub link in the description. Each service is a singleton. We only ever have one build service, one inventory service and so on. That means no new constructor. The module itself is the instance. Most services have an initialize function in it. Here any needed objects can be created or non-yielding startup code can be executed. In this example, we're inside build service client. So the singleton table is named exactly that. Always keep service names explicit to maintain readability. in it creates a model called parts and stores it on the service. The service then exposes the build function. It spawns a part, sets it frame to the pass in parameter and parents it under self.parts. By default, the current Luau type checker struggles to understand the true type of self. In order to fix this, we need to ditch the colon operator and pass self in as the first parameter with our defined type. Member variables can be defined by unionuning a table of our defined variables to the type. Additionally, type cast the return service for proper IntelliSense when used in another script. Now let's use the service we just created. Create a client script inside of starter player scripts and name it client. This contains basic startup logic for our client sided services. For demonstration purposes, I'll use the build function here. Typically, startup scripts will simply initialize all of our services. If order matters or the init function takes any parameters, you can initialize each service manually. Otherwise create a simple loop that calls in it on a recognized services. In order for client and server communication to be possible, we must use remote events and functions. Remote instances should not be created manually. Manual creation leads to messy hierarchy trees, dependency on names, and hard to manage version diffs. Instead, create remotes through code. A simple remote event wrapper can be created in less than 50 lines of code and solves all of these issues. There are plenty of open source solutions such as Biteet, Blink, or Zap. I personally created my own networking solution that I use in all of my games, and I'll be using it for the example shown. Whatever networking library you use or create should be placed into a new folder called packages. Packages are reusable scripts that are not reliant on any specific game logic, meaning they can easily be dropped into any project. If you are using VS Code, I recommend using the Wall-E package manager as I mentioned in my previous tutorial video. Start by mirroring the service setup on the server. Inside of the initialize function, create any needed networking solutions. My networker library is designed for easy communication between either side of the network. Simply create the client and server versions of the networker, define any functions the client has access to call, and use the built-in methods to communicate. I'm not going to go in depth into my specific networking solution as it could vary from yours. If you're interested in mine, there are docs on the GitHub repository in the description. Instead of clients telling the server directly, I built a part here, it should ask, can I build here? The server would then validate the request and potentially send some response if needed. In this example, the client calls the serverowned attempt build function within its build method. In this case, the attempt build validates by creating a 5-second cool down between builds. Don't forget the server startup script inside of server script service. In order to modulize reusable game logic, most professional developers utilize object-oriented programming to create classes. Similarly to the service structure, create dedicated class folders under shared and server script service. This video will not be teaching object-oriented programming. So if you're unfamiliar with this paradigm, I recommend doing some research on your own. Leave a comment if you'd be interested in a separate video covering object-oriented programming in depth. In this example, I will create a spike class. Now, instead of build service creating a new part, it will create a new spike object instead. When a player touches a spike, they'll now be damaged. Custom models, VFX, and other instances should be placed inside of an assets folder under replicated storage. For example, my spike class will now use this custom spike mesh instead of a basic part. For the sake of example and to make things more interesting, I've hooked up the clients build function to call attempt build whenever the mouse is clicked. I initialize this behavior within the init function. Modules provide shared functionality, data or utilities that other scripts can depend on. Follow the same shared versus server rules from before, creating their respective folders. I take module organization a step further by grouping them into clear categories like core, game, math, and platform. This way, it's immediately obvious where any script belongs and where someone should look to find it. Keep modules small and focused. Math helpers, reusable functions, pure data tables, and so on. User interface is one of the easiest places for projects to get messy. Professional teams prevent this by keeping UI modular and scalable. Many developers use declarative UI frameworks for this. React, Fusion, and VID are the main options. I currently use React and I've shipped production games with Fusion as well. With that said, I know many Roblox developers aren't ready to dive into declarative workflow, but here's a middle ground that I recommend. Place all interface code under a tople UI module in replicated storage. This module acts as the UI initializer. Inside, create folders for interface types such as menus or HUD. In this example, I have a left sidebar HUD element and an inventory menu. Each feature gets its own module script that exposes its functionality and an init function if needed. Just like services, the top level UI script should initialize these features. Finally, make sure the UI initializer is called inside your client startup script. This approach keeps the familiar Roblox workflow while still giving you scalable modular UI design. As mentioned earlier, packages are reusable scripts that aren't tied to any specific game logic, which means they can be dropped into any project. Professional developers rely on them to avoid reinventing the wheel and to keep their code base clean. Here are a few core packages that I personally use across all of my projects. Signal, a pure code replacement for bindable events, more efficient, easier to work with, and hands down the one package I wouldn't want to develop without. Charm, an atomic state manager that pairs perfectly with declarative UI frameworks. Sift, a comprehensive table utility library packed with useful functions. Data service, a full persistent data solution with automatic client replication and observable values. Janitor, a lightweight cleanup module that makes managing connections and instances painless. These packages keep your projects modular, predictable, and ready to scale. Like I mentioned earlier, I manage all of these through Wall-E for versioning and easy updates. This is how professionals structure Roblox projects. Services for game logic, clear modules, scalable UI, and reusable packages. Together, they keep projects clean and scalable. Your exact setup may differ slightly, but the principle is the same. Organize early to avoid chaos later.

n8IDTRW1EfM	Why YOU Need A Module Loader | Roblox Studio	Ludius	24564	10:27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8IDTRW1EfM	roblox scripting tutorial	Let me ask you something. Does your workspace look something like this? >> Oh, hell no. >> Because if it does, then you got severe organization issues. And I don't blame you. In the YouTube space, which is where I'm assuming you're learning most of your scripting from, people don't really tell you about what's the best way to optimize your code or what are the most common practices used in this space. Listen, bro, you can't have your workspace looking like this. This just looks disorganized. If I wanted to commission a scriptor and I see their organization looking like this, you'd be immediately disqualified. Something that's a lot more attractive is using module loaders. And if you don't know what module loaders are, then pay close attention to this video because I'm going to put you on some serious game right now. Even though this is going to be more of a quote unquote boring tutorial because of the content of it, I promise you that learning module loaders is something that you will definitely not regret. I cannot stress this enough. Ever since I learned them, bro, I've been using them nonstop, bro. I'm serious. Every single project that I've created so far is using my module loader system. It's that strong. But yeah, I feel like I'm yapping too much, right? So, let me shut up and start the video that you actually came here to watch. Section one, introduction to module loaders. I think that the best way to start is by explaining what exactly is a module loader, what it's used for, and its advantages, right? So, let's start there. A module loader is an infrastructure system that makes organizing and utilizing your scripts in your game a lot easier. As its name clearly says, it uses module scripts. And I'm assuming you already know what a module is, but if you don't, it's just a script that doesn't run by itself by default. And also, the contents of it can be accessed by other scripts by requiring the module script, which just returns whatever you're returning in that script. I'm not going to explain it any further than that. If you need further explanation, then go and do some research on it. But yeah, back to module loaders. Their way of organizing your scripts through the use of module scripts. What does this mean? Instead of using the popular local scripts and server scripts, you do almost everything in module scripts. If you know about module scripts, this is where you're going to start saying, "Well, Ludius, if I put all the code in modules, the code won't run because module scripts code doesn't run by default when the game starts and it's used to store data and blah blah blah." And you know what? I ain't going to lie, bro. It's a valid concern. But here's how module loaders work. They have mostly module scripts, but they also have one local script and one server script, and they both require all the scripts that are available to them and run them. This way, all your code will run when the game starts. Obviously, the scripts need to have some code and a certain structure to them so that this is possible. But I'll show you all that later on the video. But hopefully you get the general idea of how this works. Section two, its coolest advantage. In my experience, module loaders open the door to a couple of very cool possibilities, but by far the coolest advantage is that you'll no longer need bindable events when coding. Ever since I've started using module loaders, I haven't used bindable events once. And if you're a beginner, I know I got your full attention now. You're probably so confused, but don't worry, bro. I got you. Since most of your code is in module scripts, then that means that most of your scripts will be able to require each other and use each other, which is what bindable events are used for, making these absolutely useless, unless you're prototyping, but even then it's kind of meh. Section three, setup. All right, now let's talk about the setup. Every module loader is divided into at least three sections. It's server section holding all the scripts that are going to be accessible by the server, and it also contains a script that requires and runs all the script. We'll call this the loader script. All of this goes inside a folder that goes inside service because that's a server exclusive section. Then there's its local section holding all the scripts that are going to be accessible by the client and exclusively by the client. And it contains a script that requires and runs all the scripts just like the server section. So yeah, this also has a loader script. All of this goes inside a folder that goes inside replicated at first because that's the client exclusive section and it also has its global section holding all the scripts that are going to be accessible by both the client and the server and it also has an initiator module script which is what the previous two loaders make use of. All of this goes inside a folder that goes inside replicated storage because that's the shared section. So both client and server can see this. So how does this look on studio then? It looks like this section 4 code. Okay. Okay, now into the content of every single script in the module loader. So here you have the loader scripts and all the other scripts we can call the host scripts because they're being kind of like hosted by the module loader. I don't know if that makes sense. Hopefully it did. Let's get the content of each loader script first. Both the local script and the server script loaders have the same content. So they both get replicated storage. Then the global module loader folder and then they get and require the loader that's inside that. After that they call a function inside the global loader module called load all. Why do they both do this? Because the logic that really matters is going to be inside the global loader module. In this script is where the real magic happens. This script first of all gets run service because that's what we're going to use to detect whether this script is being run by the server or the client. Why is this important? Since both of these scripts use this so that they can load all the modules, we need to filter which modules the client can run and which modules the server can run. Because remember, they're in different places. is there are going to be certain scripts that are going to be exclusive to the client and other scripts are going to be exclusive to the server. How do I know which ones can run on the client and which ones can run on the server? Well, first of all, the ones in replicated storage should be able to run both on client and on server. Hence why I refer to them as global scripts. Client can only see the ones in replicated first and the server can only see the ones in server script service apart from the replicated storage ones. That is so the client has to run the scripts in replicated first but also in replicated storage and the server has to run the scripts in server script service but also in replicated storage as well. The logic that detects which scripts can run is done here in the script. So as I said the first thing we get is the run service for that. After this we can start with the main function load all. Inside this function the first thing we're going to do is get the global scripts folder. Then we create a variable that will hold the specific folder containing the scripts depending on if it's client or if it's server running the script. So, we're just going to create that variable and set its value to nil for now. Moving on, we'll get to one of the most important parts. We set an if statement to determine if the current script is being run by server. And we also add an else- if check to see if it's run by the client. These two ifs have different content. Of course, if the server one, we get the server scripts folder, and we set the server or local scripts variable equal to the server scripts variable. On the client one, we get the client scripts and set the server or local scripts to the client scripts variable. And with this, we now have the folder of the scripts that it has to run regardless of if it's running on the client or server, which is our variable RS scripts. And we also have the client exclusive or server exclusive scripts folder that it needs to load, which is our server or local scripts variable. Now, we got to load all of them. And we'll do that by iterating through both of these folders. Checking if what it's iterating through is a module. If so, we require that module. We check if that module has an element called unload, which should be a function. More on this in a bit. Stay with me here. And if it has that onload, then we call that function. I know you might be a bit confused because of the onload function, but I'm going to proceed to explain that. Now, this has to do with the scripts that your module loader will be hosting. Let's take test global script for example. Ignore the test global script 2 variable thing for now. I want you to see how I added a function to this module table. Yes, you can add functions into module tables like this. I prefer to do it like this because I think it looks cleaner, but whatever way you add function works. The point is this module needs to include a function called unload. and the content you want the script to run at the start of the game goes here inside the unload function. As long as you have that function and you call it from the global loading script, whatever code is inside this unload function will run whenever your game starts. All I have inside this script is a print that says the name of the script in brackets and then loaded after it. If I go ahead and test this now, the first print we get is this one. Test global script loaded. And just so that you see that I'm not pretending or something, if I click this print, it takes me right back to the script that this print is from, which of course is test global script. So, as you can see, it's working. I have other similar scripts with similar content. That's why you can see more prints. For example, you can see test global script 2, the one from test server script, prints from test global scripts. And again, I'll explain this in a bit. And the last print is just the one from test local script. All of these prints right here are not random, neither in order nor in repetition. The reason why the test global script and test global script 2 print repeat is because remember that the server and client both run the scripts that are in replicated storage. That's how it's set up. Therefore, we get two prints. Now, I'm explain why we're getting these two prints. The ones from test global script 2 test function call. First off, we already know the reason why we get two. These scripts are replicated storage. But where do these prints come from? Well, if you click any of these, it'll take you to the source, right? Test global script 2 has another function inside it called test function which I'm calling back in test global script. The test functions here do not run when the game start. The only one that does is the unload. So then what's going on with this function? Well, this is the interesting part. You can have here pieces of code that can be run by other scripts as long as you connect them via functions. This is an example of two scripts communicating without the need of bindable events. Test global script is using code from test global script 2 without the need for a bindable event. You can have as many functions here as you want. That's what's so cool about module loaders. Now you can communicate between scripts that are being run in the same place, meaning both scripts on the client or both scripts on the server without having to go through the whole bindable events. Then you just require the module you want to use like I did at the top. And you have access to all of its functions, but not only functions, you have access to other types of data that the module might be offering. And yeah, that's why we're getting those two other prints. Hopefully, you were able to understand this. I think it's pretty cool. Also, something to note here is that not all your scripts have to have the unload function. Sometimes you don't want the script to run any code when the game loads. Sometimes all you want it to do is just to hold data or hold code so that other scripts can use it later, which is fine, too. Conclusion section. All right, bro. Listen, this is just surface level stuff when it comes to module loaders. You can have other very cool customization features for your module loader. Like for example, making specific scripts run before others. Not going to lie, that's the only thing that comes to mind right off the bat, but but I'm sure there's more you can do with this. This is just how I manage my module loader simplified into the most digestible format so that you can consume it can customize yours however you want if you're feeling bold. Also, let me shout out Nstromus Bro's a real one. He helped me understand module loaders a lot better. He has his own module loader and it's open source to the public by the way called Cisco. The link will be in the description. I might have to do a tutorial on it on the future, but we'll see. If enough people ask me for more advanced module loader videos, I might just have to. So, leave a comment on what other videos you'd like to see. All of this being said, keep leveling up, bro. Be safe and I'll see you when I see you.

w4anCL9HJ6k	You CAN Script. Let me PROVE IT to you.. (Part 2)	script_ing	31638	27:12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4anCL9HJ6k	roblox scripting tutorial	you can script. Even if you think you can't, you can. And in this video, I'm going to prove it to you again. Now, if you haven't seen part one of this video series, then please pause this video and go view that video. Just like in part one, I'm going to teach you some stuff and then I'll give you some quizzes to prove that you can do it, even without me telling you step by step. Now, as I teach you more and more stuff, the quizzes will get harder and harder. Just know that I believe in you. And as long as you watch the entire video and don't skip around, you will understand it and everything will be okay. Every time you get a quiz right, you get one point. And there are five points in total. Let's see how many points you can get by the end of the video. Once again, welcome to my channel. My name is Kushall. I've been scripting for almost 10 years now. I've contributed to over 70 million visits for several front page games, and you can see all of the games that I've worked on over the years over here. I also have games of my own, like this one, which is called Elemental Adventures, and is coming out sometime this year. And my mission is to teach you Roblox scripting in a fun way that helps you learn scripting so that one day you can also make your own awesome games. All right, so first let's get rid of the spawn location because it's going to cause issues. So you can just rightclick it on your explorer and then click on delete. And let's warm up with a quick review. All right, so here's a warm-up. I want you guys to create a red ball. So, it's going to look just like this. And I want you to do it using the script. So, you're going to inside of server script service, click on the plus sign, click on script, and then I want you to type the code out here that tells Roblox to create this ball. Now, if you've watched part one of this series, then you should know how to do this. Even if you've watched it and you forgot, then please feel free to just pause this video and then check out that video, relearn what you have to learn, and then come back to this video. So, you're just going to create this red ball and you're going to make this script do it. And I'm going to count to five and then I'll show you the solution. So, just pause this video, go ahead and do it and then come back. Ready? 1 2 3 4 5. All right. So, if I wanted to script this ball, I would go into here and then I'd start scripting local part equals instance new part workspace. So, remember this thing right here? This means create a new part and put it in workspace. Now, why did we say workspace? Because we want the part to go in workspace just like the ball is. So, this ball is inside of workspace. That's why we put workspace here. Why did we put part here? Because this ball is actually a part as you can see. And then to make this part into a ball, we're going to say part.shape equals ball. And then we want this thing to be red. And then notice that part. brick color. So the brick color of the part is set to really red. So I would type part dot brick color equals brick color new really red. Just like that. It's going to create the part, make it a ball, and then make it red. So now if I delete this, I'll go back into home and click play. Boom. There it is. There's my red part. And yeah, I can actually move it around. Now your code might look different than mine, and that's okay. So maybe you called this something different. Maybe you put the brick color over here and the shape over here. That's okay. As long as you got this right here. As long as you were able to produce this. That's okay. So nice job. You finished the warm-up. Unfortunately, the warm-up doesn't give you points. So now we're going to actually start learning. All right. So in the previous video of the series, we talked about how you can get this part to move around, right? So we had this position right here. And then we talked about how we can do like part.position equals vector 3 new and then we said like okay what if we wanted to put it in the sky then we can do that and then when you ran it the part would actually spawn all the way in the sky it's going to it's going to hit me. So we already know about this and position remember that position required a vector 3 new this thing basically just means it needs three numbers. So we gave it three numbers. Now, now let's talk about size. So, here's your part and we can actually do other things with this vector 3 new thing. So, we use vector 3 for position. We can actually also use it for something called size. Now, what do you think size is? It's literally how big this thing is, right? So, right now the size is 4 um 1.2 comma 2. What if I set this to like 7, 7, 7? Well, there you go. Now it's bigger. And now we need to figure out how we can tell this script to set the size to that number. Here's how we would do it. You'd say part size equals vector 3 new. Remember vector 3 new. This basically just means I'm about to give you three numbers. And then we said 7, 7, 7. So create the create the part, make it into a ball, make it red. And now we're finally learning about size. So this is how you can make things bigger. So now when you actually run this or play it, you'll see that you told Roblox to make this part into a bigger part. And now you should have this giant ball that you can just push around a lot harder to get this ball rolling than the other one that was smaller because this part is bigger. All right. So now I think that I want to make this shape into a block. Now, how did I know to type block here? Because whenever you create a part, you can see that one of the properties of this part is shape. And then one of the shapes that you can use is block. So that's how I figured out that I had to put block there. So this thing came from over here. So you can set the part.shape to a ball, a block, corner wedge, cylinder wedge, whatever. I'm using block for this video. So now if I click on play, you'll notice that now it's a giant cube. And you can't really move it around because it's a cube. Well, you can, but it's harder. As you can see, I'm trying to shove it. Okay. All right. All right. First quiz. So, right now, the part size is 7 by 7 by 7. So, that's why it's a cube, right? I want this part size to be two times bigger. So, instead of 777, I want it to be bigger. Two times bigger. So, think about what that means. Okay. So, here's a hint. You need to change these numbers to something. Make it two times bigger. That's the first quiz. I'm going to give you 5 seconds. You got this. Just pause the video. Try it out. Just make this part two times bigger. 1 2 3 4 5. All right. Here's how you do it. So, part size equals vector 3. 777. That's the original size. If I want this to be two times bigger, guess what I have to do to these three numbers? I just have to make them two times bigger. Right? So this seven becomes a 14. This seven becomes a 14. And this seven becomes a 14. And then suddenly when you play, you should see that you have this giant even bigger part. Now it's even harder for me to move. I don't even Oh, I can move it. As you can see, I'm slowly just shoving this part. I'm trying to get it to move. Now there you go. Hopefully you got the first quiz correct. So wait. So yay. So that's how you do it. You just have to basically multiply each number by two. All right. All right. Awesome. Awesome. So now I want to talk to you about material and this is going to be really cool. So stay with me. Okay. Here is the part. Now if you look inside of this part, you can see there's something called material. This is going to look really cool. Ready? Watch. Watch. So you can actually set the material to all of these different things here. You can basically choose one of these things and you can set the material to anything you want. So like for example, I can set it to brick. And you can see now it's a red bricky part. And then I can also set this to like carpet. And now it's more of a carpet theme. And there's all of these things that I can set it to like mud. And that's what a red muddy part looks like. Now, how can we do that using a script? Well, it's pretty simple. It's just like shape. Part do material equals and then you put whatever material you want. So like for example, maybe I want it to be brick part. I just type in brick. Now, make sure that you spell it correctly. So, inside of part material, there's all of these things you can choose. Just make sure you spell it correctly. So, now when you run this, you can see that Roblox made your part into a red giant brick part. All right. All right. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Now, right now, this part is actually a giant cube. I want this part to become a wall. And the way I'm going to do this is if you just click on your part, look at your size. Notice that the x, y, and z are the same exact number. So, if you've ever like in math class, you know how they'll teach you about like length, width, and height. That's what these three numbers mean. If I want this thing to be a wall, then I have to shorten one of these numbers. So, maybe I'll shorten this Z to like two, and now it's a wall. So, 1442. That basically means the Y14 is the height. The X14 is like the length of this, and then the Z2 is the length of that. So that's how we were able to make a wall. We just had to set this Z to a two and then we've made a wall. Now in a script, you can basically do the same thing where you set this 14 to a two. So we have the X is 14, the Y is 14, and the Z is two. And now you have boom, a brick wall. You can try to push it around. It's pretty sturdy. All right. Now, if you've been enjoying this whole You can script series, then you will literally fall in love with this book that I have written specifically for you. This book is the best Roblox scripting book you're going to find online right now in this planet on planet Earth. I don't know about Mars, but on Earth, this is going to be the best Roblox scripting book that you have ever found yet. This book will teach you how to script in an easy to understand way. So, there's vocabulary list so that you don't forget what you've learned. There's also quizzes so you can practice what you've learned. There's also lines of code with complete explanations so that you can remember everything and easily understand it. So, if you're interested in this book, make sure to check the link in the comment. This book has already been read hundreds and hundreds of times by people all over the world. There's many, many copies of this book all circulating throughout the United States right now. And if you haven't gotten this book already, you are missing out on a lot of easy to understand explanations just like what I've been doing in these videos. So, make sure to check the link in description and you can get yourself your own copy of this book. All right, ready for quiz number two. So, we now know how to make a wall. We now know how to make it red. And we also I mean, we've already known how to make it red, but now we know how to make the material into a brick. So, now let's say that I want you to create a sand wall. So, maybe you like Naruto, maybe you like uh playing with like elemental attacks or whatever. Maybe your game is like an elemental game. Maybe it's a fantasy game. Or maybe someone hired you and they said, "Hey, can you make a sand wall for me using scripts and that's what you're going to do?" So, this is quiz two. I want you to create this using your script. So, edit whatever you have to edit here. Here, I'll give you some hints. The brick color is set to that thing right there. It's called cork. Make sure you spell it correctly. The material has changed. Notice that. And then the size is the same as we had before on our wall. So figure out what you have to change here in order to get this thing. So just pause the video. I'm going to count to five. You can take as long as you need. I'm just going to count to five and then continue. So pause the video. You got this. Just remember cork and sand. And that's about it. That's all you need. Just change this script in a way where it creates this and then I'll give you the solution. Ready? I'm going to count to five. So, 1 2 3 4 5. Okay, hopefully by now you've already paused the video. You've already created this or you've tried to. Here's how I would do it. So, notice that the only things that we need to change are the cork, the brick color, and the material, which is going to be sand. So, part.brick color was really red. Now, part brick color has to be cork. And then the material was brick, but we want the material to be sand. So, we're just going to set this to sand. And I'm going to get rid of this. And now my script is going to create it for me. And as you can see, we got the same exact result, a sand part. And this is like a sand wall. So maybe this is like for an elemental game. So here's your sand wall that you've created. Nice job if you got this correct. This is your second point, assuming that you already got the first point correct. So there you go. All right. So now I'm going to give you a hypothetical scenario which is going to look amazing. Okay. So so far we know part size it requires three numbers. This two right here is the depth. This 14 right here the middle number is the height. Now what if I wanted this sand wall to grow? Wouldn't it seem, you know, probable if what I did was we started at one and then we went so we started at one and then we set the middle number to two and then we set the middle number to three and then we set the middle number to four and then we set the middle number to five and then we just kept on going like this where we just increased it one by one by one like this. Wouldn't it make like a cool animation? Like this is like frame by frame thinking. So like it just keeps on increasing by one like that. And then finally once it gets to maybe let's see how long it takes. Okay. So finally at 14 it stops. Wouldn't that seem cool? It would look like a wall is being made. Wouldn't that seem like really cool? Actually it would. Right. And that was pretty simple. All we did was we made this one and then we made it two. All we're doing is just changing the middle number and increasing it by one every single time. Now, couldn't we do that using code? Yes, we can. And here's how we would do it. So, what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to take this part size. I'm going to move it here. And this is just so it's easy to um explain it, but you guys can do whatever you want with your code. But basically what we did was we said okay let the part size be one and then let the part size be two and then we said let the part size be three and then we said let the part size be four and then we said let the part size be five and we literally just kept on going like this where we increased it right so I'm just going to copy and paste it a whole bunch of times and then we said okay 6 okay 7 okay 8 9 10 11 and and we went all the way until 14 13 14 and all we were doing is we increased the middle number. Now, of course, there's a better way to do this, which I'm not going to teach in this video, but I will teach you probably in a later video because this is right now this is made for like absolute beginners. So, if you're watching this video, you're probably like an absolute beginner. So, here's how it's done. So, what we literally did was we're making like an animation for the wall where we just kept on increasing that Y number until it got to 14. Now, the problem with this is that it's going to increase it all instantly. Like literally, you won't like you will literally just see the completed wall. Like, so if you just run this, right? Boom. You'll literally just see the completed wall. Like, you won't see the frame by frame thing. And that's because we need to tell Roblox to wait a little bit. So, we need to tell Roblox to wait for a few seconds before it does the next thing. So it does this thing, waits for a few seconds, it does this thing, waits for a few seconds, it does this thing. And the way we do it in Roblox is we say task.we. So this task wait here, whatever number you put in here is how long Roblox will wait until it goes to this line of code. So it does this thing and then waits a little bit and then does this thing. And how long we want it to wait, maybe we want it to wait 1 second for now. So it starts out with the size being 1412. that it's going to wait 1 second. And now it's going to be 1422. It's going to wait 1 second. And we're literally just going to spam this. So I'm literally just going to spam this test. So I'm just going to spam it. So every single time it's going to wait 1 second, get a little bit bigger. Wait 1 second, get a little bit bigger. Hopefully you guys can see this, right? All we're doing is just increasing the Y number. So we're going 1 2 3 4 all the way down to 14. So set the size to 1412. Wait 1 second. Now 142. Wait one second. 1432. Wait one second. And that idea is what's going to get us to this cool animation that you see here. And now your sand wall is being built. Doesn't that look awesome? And you can see it's just it's going to take like 14 seconds, but it's just slowly being made. This is the basis for how your favorite games like Battlegrounds or like whatever games you guys play nowadays, anime games, uh any games that use like VFX, this is kind of like the basics for how this is the basis for how those games do that. Now, what if we want it to be faster? Well, we could decrease this number, right? So, instead of waiting 1 second, maybe we wanted to wait 0.1 seconds. So, wait 0.1 second. Wait 0.1 second. And that's going to make the animation happen a lot faster. So, I'm just replacing all the ones with 0.1. Now, when I run this, well, that was pretty quick, wasn't it? So, here's another thing we would do. We could put a task. In the beginning, so now we're telling Roblox, wait 3 seconds and then make your part and then do all the cool stuff with it and then do all of the animation with it. So, this just means wait 3 seconds and then do everything. This is just going to allow us to actually see our animation. So, now whoa. And there's our wall right behind us. Now, here is the next quiz. So, this is going to be easy for you if you got the previous quiz correct. I want this part. So, I decided I don't want sand. I decided I want ice. So, think about what you have to change here. So, instead of making it a sand wall, I want it to be a an ice wall. So, what do you have to change here to make the part into an ice wall? There's two things you have to change. The same two things as the last quiz. For brick color, you can use whatever color you want that resembles like an icy kind of theme. And then for material, think about what you have to change to get it to become an ice wall. So, I'm going to count to five. So, just pause the video. Go ahead. Turn this into an ice wall. Here we go. So, one, two, three, four, five. All right. So, hopefully you guys have your ice wall. Here's how I would do it. So, I'd go click play. So, here's my sand wall. And if I go into this part, you can see the material. You can actually set it to ice. And then you have to set the brick color into some blue color that you like. So, I actually like this color right here, pastel blue. So, I'm going to stop this and go over here. brick color new pastel blue and then set the material to ice. And now 3 seconds later, you will have an ice wall as you can see. So hopefully you got this correct and congratulations on getting it correct. If you did, if you didn't, that's okay. We're still learning. And this is how you can make an ice wall. You can actually move it around. Oh, it's actually pretty slippery. Look at this. So here's what we're going to do for the next quiz. So just follow me. We're going to first start by making this parts brick color into a red color. So in workspace, you should have yourself a part that is red. All right. So now I want you to code it so that after 3 seconds, this part changes from red to blue. So just do that. After 3 seconds, we just want it to change from red to blue. So just pause the video, try to figure it out on your own, and then I'll help you after. So this should be easy. Think about what we just did. Think about how you can do that. So, 3 seconds later, just make the part go from red to blue. So, I'm going to count to five. Make sure you pause the video and go ahead and try it on your own. So, 1 2 3 4 5. All right. So, right now it's red and we want it to change to blue after 3 seconds. So, we're going to do task that wait three and then set the brick color to blue. So, now we're going to click on play. And now after 3 seconds, this thing should change its color to blue. And there you go. All right. So now for the last part of this video and the last quiz, I want to talk to you about a new instance. So so far, so far we've been doing things with instance. So so far we've been doing global part equals instance new part workspace, right? So this right here just means to create a part. And this part right here is a type of instance. So this is like a thing that you can create, right? And guess what? Fire is fire is also another thing that you can create. So this line of code creates the part and puts it in workspace just like this. But did you also know that you can also do the same exact thing with a different instance? So this is part we can actually do the same thing with fire. So local fire. So remember this part right here is I'm telling Roblox I want to create a new variable called fire. And then I'm gonna say let that fire variable be equal to that thing right there. So this part creates the part puts it in workspace. And then this part creates fire. And instead of putting the fire in workspace, now we're actually telling Roblox put it inside of the part. And guess what this is going to do here. This this isn't the last quiz. So this isn't the last quiz, but I kind of want you to guess like what do you think this is going to do? So, we create a part and then we put fire onto that part. So, pause the video, try to explain it to yourself. This isn't the quiz, but try to just explain it to yourself. What do you think this is going to do? So, I'll give you 5 seconds. So, 1 2 3 4 5. Okay. So, if you guessed that this code is going to put fire on the part, so it's going to basically create a flaming part, then you're correct. And nice job. So now I'm going to play this and you'll see now the part is on fire. So this is actually really fun. Now we've got a flaming part. And now what we're going to do is I want this to be like a meteor. So what we're going to do is we're going to say part dot um let's do part material equals neon. So neon this is actually a material that basically makes this part glow. So this is just a neon material. This is actually one of my favorite materials. This basically just makes it glow. And then we're going to say part.brick color equals brick color. red. So now we're creating a neon red part. And then we're going to set the shape to a ball. Do you see where we're going with this? We're actually going to make meteors. So now we've got ourselves a red glowing ball. And we've also added fire onto our ball. And guess what that does? It creates a meteor. And for the last part of this video, remember how in part one we created like we made 200 falling red balls from the sky? Guess what we're going to do now? In part two, we're going to create 200 falling red meteors from the sky. And that's going to be your last quiz. So, you're welcome to look at how we did it in part one. This is a pretty easy quiz. So, all you have to do is basically just make this thing fall from the sky. Make it happen 200 times. So 200 meteors are going to fall from the sky and you can just make them all fall from the same position and that's it. So I'm going to give you 5 seconds. So you can pause the video, try it out. You're welcome to like use Google, you can look at the previous part of this video series and just try it out. Okay? So 1 2 3 4 5. All right? Let's see how well you did. So this is our first part. Now I'm going to show you the solution to this final part of this video. the final quiz of the final quiz of this video. And what we're going to do is we're basically just going to get this thing to fall from the sky. We're going to get 200 of them to fall from the sky. So this part creates the whoop this part creates the flaming red ball. We want 200 of them. So we need to surround it with a for loop. For i= 1 200 do that means to do it 200 times. Then what are we trying to do 200 times? We're trying to do all of this 200 times. So this part means do it 200 times. This part creates the ball. This part puts fire on the ball. And then this part means to stop doing it. So it basically everything between this and this which is this will happen 200 times. So this is going to create 200 balls. And you'll see that it does create 200 balls. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. This is it's actually pretty funny. Okay. Now, we've created our 200 balls, but we want them to all fall from the sky. And so, we need to do we need what we need to do is we need to part.position equals vector 3 new zero. And then maybe I'll drop it like 500 studs above the ground. So, this means 500 studs above the ground. And then we're going to set part.edor to false. And then part collide to true. So create the part, make it neon, which makes it glow, make it red, turn it into a ball, and then basically move it to the sky. That's what this does. This means move it 500 studs above the ground. And then make sure it can fall. And then make sure that it can touch other things because it's going to be like a meteor. And then this part creates the fire. So now when I run this, you'll see we now have I think it bounced. We have 200 falling red balls, but they're actually all like I think they all fell in the same exact position. And so if I drag this out, you can see there's actually two Oh my goodness, there's 200 of these balls. So hopefully if you were able to get this far, then congratulations. You have unlocked the final point of this video. And I hope that you'll stick around and subscribe and you'll be able to wait for part three. And then when that's out, hopefully you'll get all the points in part three and then part four and part five. And you can see where I'm going with this. I'm going to make a whole bunch of parts for this video series because I know that you guys love this video series so much. So, thank you for watching and remember to subscribe and I'll see you in the next video. And enjoy your 200 flaming meteors.	26768	t	The content directly addresses beginner intimidation in game development by providing accessible, step-by-step instructions for dynamic object creation and property manipulation in Roblox.	{"Roblox scripting tutorial","Instance.new part Roblox","Roblox Luau programming beginners","change part color script Roblox","Roblox Vector3 position scripting"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	[{"apis": ["Instance.new", "Workspace"], "problem": "Create a new part instance and parent it to the workspace via script", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["Part.Shape", "Enum.PartType"], "problem": "Change the geometric shape of a part to a sphere (ball)", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["Part.BrickColor", "BrickColor.new"], "problem": "Modify the color of a part using the BrickColor system", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["Part.Position", "Vector3.new"], "problem": "Set a part's 3D coordinates using Vector3", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["Part.Size", "Vector3.new"], "problem": "Adjust the scale or dimensions of a part using Vector3", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}]	Manipulating Part properties and Vector3 fundamentals in Luau	f	\N	\N

rO-JTXh1nug	How I Learned to Script on Roblox (My First EVER Game!)	TheDevKing	213835	11:53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO-JTXh1nug	roblox scripting tutorial	alright boys looking back today with a brand new video in today's video I'm gonna be explaining how I learned to shift on roblox alright now we were taking a trip down memory lane guys I'm not gonna lie this is gonna be a bit a bit sentimental for me I guess you could say but I'm gonna teach you guys how I learned the script I'm gonna show you everything I did what I didn't do I'm even going to show you guys like my first ever game I'm gonna explain how long it took all that stuff my entire shifting journey I'll explain it all in this video so yeah it's gonna be interesting so people asked this question will be every single day they're like dude how did you learn the script how long would it take you all that stuff okay and um I was sending all that but I'm also gonna show you guys my first ever game okay and that's gonna be embarrassing it literally the game is so bad I wouldn't even like it's private right but I'll Shami and I'll play on the video but it's so bad okay I'm also playing guys also explain the best way I think to learn just kind of today and how you can learn script in my opinion so yeah be sure you like yourself be out guys and subscribe if you want more robust development videos like this one and Alyssa started all right so first things first at the beginning okay so my programming or scripting career started in about late 2017 when I first tried to learn Python okay which is a different programming language if you guys didn't know robots uses Lua so yeah anyways so I learned a bit of it but then ended up stopping because I had no use for it okay I basically learned the language but then I was like okay what do I do now right I was like I didn't know what to do with it I didn't really know how to make anything else outside of tutorials so I just kind of gue I just kind of quit right I didn't really know what to do with it so I'm I stopped programming but I didn't have fun with it I enjoyed it I like programming it's fun for me right so in the summer of 2018 I decided okay I want to learn how to script on roblox so I did right so the main way I learn how to ship though is probably what most of you have done but also there's a few of the ways that helped me as well so yeah so the main way I learned a script alright here it is boys the golden question I learned to script few different ways but I would say the main way I learned to script was watching YouTube videos okay it's specifically Peas Potter right he made it very easy to understand he form out of this super nicely and I just I loved it right like I would literally stay up all night watching his videos and skipping along with him alright I'm not joking boys like I was obsessed with learning Austrian okay it was like my biggest hobby at the time to be honest with you because there's a lot of fun for me right I enjoyed it um I can literally like yeah I literally remember the Sun rising while I was trying to watch his videos like I'm not joking like it it was just like it was a good time in my life okay that's all I would say um but okay obviously I still didn't learn everything from his video Cilla right like he didn't teach me every single thing I still had to learn a few other things um you know I sort of fill in some gaps here and there and also he actually stopped uploading which didn't really help right he didn't upload any more didn't teach me anything new so that was kind of a shame but yeah actually that's kind of one of the reasons I started my youtube channel or this channel because um you know the rules dude there really wasn't any good like you know roblox development channels still like uploading his like alpha blocks wasn't up putting much of the time pee spots up and up letting you know they all gonna stop so yeah anyways that's why I made the channel but that's not the point awesome that later okay anyways so what are the other ways I learned script so um another way I learned right after I finished all those videos I was - I was still trying to learn some things I'll show starting to like understand data storage stuff like that so I would go on the robots wiki okay if you don't know what that is I'll show you I'll gradually right now but basically the robots wiki is like a it's a wiki right before robots developers and so there's a bunch of cool like articles on here about like like certain stuff like for example let me go in the learn roblox section as you can see there's a camera manipulation there's a catalog api's there's actually that's kind of interesting I'm a Tigers fan later anyway so there's a article to make on a game had a you know add sound and music all this certain stuff right it wow that's kind of interesting Lua and how it she's sharp compare okay anyways a lot of cool stuff there right and a lot of things you can learn but also like the API reference that was a flood thing I feel a lot of things for me right so like certain things like you know I don't know like if I need to see the properties or or like the functions of an object right that's how I checked in here sort of like that right it's how I'd reinforce certain things and just kind of remember the key words to like that so definitely use this if you aren't already but that's not the way I learned I guess and then another way mocchi among certain that yet but yeah other we probably free models like just kind of reverse engineering those like opening the scripts to what they said but anyways let me go and show you guys now my first ever game okay this is gonna be embarrassing okay so this important thing is to I actually was applying things that I learned okay I wasn't just like watching the videos and then you know doing something else after or like not even coating at all I wouldn't I was watching the videos I was also I had robux to do open and I was writing down everything I saw right cuz I wanted to reinforce that code in my brain I wanted to learn I remember it right I wanted to know what it does not want to do it I wanted to be able to test it myself okay so definitely if you're watching youtube tutorials that is a must write down what you're doing okay code with the guy if you have two monitors that is very helpful I thankfully did so I could you know I had my video on here and then I had my iRobot studio monitor right so that was useful so um definitely do that if you can are anyway so but once I learned the basics right and I thought I could program a few things I started working on an actual game okay now the first game I ever made and I would say this really is a first thing I ever made it was called tunneling simulator okay and it never released and never saw the light of day unfortunately I know I say you know finish her games but this is in the past you know I wasn't the same guy was back then but um it was it's so bad alright now obviously guys this game okay I'm pretty sure I made it like a fall 2018 you'll see in a second here let me pull it up oh gosh this is gonna be embarrassing all right here we go so as you can see right here got the game yes I was right fall 2018 it was August I think I'm that month is yeah come on birthdays in July when we're saying all right so yeah August and um that's that's it so here we go boys we're gonna play it right now it was public for it I can slight bit of time I think actually I think it was public recently but I forgot the private it so yeah as you can see this was the thumbnail I don't know why that was a thumbnail but yeah you also have one game fast that's cool all right let's do one plate I'm gonna with your time let's see you and says oh god this is gonna be so embarrassing okay all right boy just all I'm gonna say is don't judge too hard member this is this was two years ago okay two years ago so I'm not as bad as skipping anymore okay so um yeah also um someone actually something I should help me with a build an app by the way one of my friends he actually put the map with me I'm so fond of the mid stage so that's cool but uh here it is guys tunneling stimulator as you can see we have this oh the quality of this thing is disgusting what is that I don't even know all right but that's that and we have a walk speed game pass thing we get you by that's pretty cool that worked good kind of a feeling I guess we had I don't think is even worse to be honest with you I I really could not figure this out back I remember struggling with this so bad can we buy it desert pickaxe I right now if the ice pickaxe no it my pickaxe is just gone now all right well um no okay well maybe Victor reset and fix that I don't know we had a little image sort of thing here I never finished it I remember I never finished that quest that doesn't even work we have our backpack okay so let me actually show you guys how this game works okay so as you can see there's a shop right here I don't know why this shop here if the shops over there that makes literally no sense but as you can see it's kind of like mining simulator but a tunnel okay so what I'm gonna do right here is add my pickaxe alright and oh the collection box doesn't show anymore I was a bug okay anyways so I have oh my gosh I messed it up when I reset okay wait let me rejoined I promise the game is insane all right let's not it's not okay but I want to get how the mechanical works okay it's probably pretty simply pull you understand it but like I said it's kind of like mining simulator but sideways it's just like a tunnel so as you can see spawn in okay and you have a pickaxe all right and you just mine so as you can see I'm selecting these things are here and it has the value of it so it's one it gets one point or whatever or one coin and then it has a health more under it so if I hold and click it'll actually mine this and as you can see it's actually it's actually working it does work and then yeah never mind it doesn't work okay I saw worked at one point guys and worked at one point but anyways that's how it works used it it would work better I used to work with her I swear I'm I guess I must add up somehow and then actually would get the thing and then I would sell it and then here it would sell and then everything would be dandy obvious as you can see this is like a little bit harder than mine but this was the game alright it wasn't actually that bad yeah it wasn't real what am I saying this thing was awful the map was really bad too um but yeah that is telling simulator that is my first ever game and man that that is that is that alright let's let's get out of there before it's too late alright anyway so that's person free game alright so now um what is the best way to learn tripping nowadays in my opinion okay nowadays of course it's watching you to this video okay it is the most easiest a straightforward way to learn watch youtube videos I believe it's super simple and super easy to learn right and actually of course we're gonna talk my own series peace pod is awesome I shout out to him you know if you want this video to do I love you but if you want to learn today you're asking what YouTube videos to watch I actually have a beginners series a beginner scripting series that literally anyone could watch and learn even if they were scripted before at all I'm not joking I've literally had countless people tell me they learn the script and I've never even met them right that's super cool but that's why my news videos right so I can teach people how to script so if you wanna learn how to script there's a link to the in that's in the description on the beginner series it's bringing this series literally if you even if you've never even opened a script before on roblox it'll teach you how to script okay it hid you from the basics basics okay so yeah be sure to watch that at the interest in learning script but as you can see here this is just two screenshots I found people were like hey deaf King I watched her stories for a while now and I've made a mini game so I'm gonna have similar to epic mini games all thanks for your love all thanks to your vids from Sweden that's super cool look at look at it look at this guy this is really cool too he says I won't with deaf King I want to thank you so much for teaching manuscript I've got together now a hundred fifty campus it's all from you that is awesome I mean man like literally the fact that I've never even met this guy he joins my game tells me this and you know I turn I'm on a script that's so cool to me that makes me happy it really does um but yeah oh if you weren't around script in my opinion watch my series it alert each other script there's so many people that are with you also be sure to join discord servers where you can connect other skippers that's important too but yeah anyways also like also and honestly guys in my entire skipping journey I was like a lone but I like I did not have a single friend also like a nun I'm not hooking nun bro like it was just me it was just me and I'm glad I've all this community honestly guys I'm sure it helps people out I'm glad I have this community so if you guys aren't already in the discourse server or you're not you know subscribe you shouldn't do that it's super cool but yeah anyways yeah that's been ripped up guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did like away guys pictures from oh my god I'm talking so fast I hope you enjoyed this video if you'd like always guys make sure to smash that like button and subscribe for more videos like this one I uploaded robots doubling videos like this all the time and it helps you out I do appreciate it so leaving like and subscribing so yeah anyways guys hope you enjoyed I'll see you guys the next one have a great day and good luck scripting if you want to learn link in description alright peace	13745	t	The content addresses a high-volume beginner query

qGYIOeELzBc	The #1 MISTAKE Beginner Scripters Are Making...	script_ing	138017	18:33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYIOeELzBc	roblox scripting tutorial	there's one really big mistake that beginners make when starting to script on Roblox the mistake is so big that it makes beginners lose months of progress and destroys all of their motivation and energy to script Bob right here is about to make that mistake and his entire scripting journey is going to fall behind by months so this is Bob and this is his first night I guess of learning scripting and this is script you may know him because this is actually me this is me when I was 12 years old in sixth grade by the way I'm currently 21 I've been scripting for 9 years now and this story that I'm about to tell you is based off of my past so I wanted to learn to script Super Saiyan Transformations like from Dragon Ball Z and I wanted to learn this very very badly because the thought of being able to script anything I wanted someday the exact way that I envisioned it made me very very excited for the future now Bob right here wants to be able to script so that he can impress his friends nothing wrong with that I mean you can't blame him at this time both me and Bob are 12 years old it's currently 600 p.m. and we're both learning to script but our approaches are very very different so let's see what Bob is up to okay looks like Bob is actually watching a scripting tutorial from future me well that's pretty good he's learning something and looks like he's headed in the right direction I mean if you're watching my scripting tutorials then you must be learning something so as long as he presses like And subscribe then you know he's all all good now let's look at me on the other hand what am I doing here so this right here is 12-year-old me and it looks like 12-year-old script is watching Dragon Ball Z okay it's very interesting we have Bob over here who's watching a scripting tutorial and then we have me who seems to be procrastinating just watching anime I mean wow this guy must be headed in the completely wrong direction he's he's not watching any scripting tutorials at all okay so now they both go to sleep so let's simulate that so they both go to sleep and then some time passes and some more time passes and suddenly it's daytime all right so now both of them have gotten some rest and let's look at what Bob is doing okay so looks like Bob is actually watching my video on how I scripted a juggernaut so from the looks of it it looks like he's watching this because it might be motiv him because maybe he's thinking about huh what if I could script this then my friends would think I'm amazing maybe he's just thinking about that or maybe he's just watching to figure out how I coded it or whatever the case may be but I would be surprised if he's watching this video on his second day of scripting because this is a very very complicated kind of thing to script for a beginner for a complete beginner I mean this thing uses things like raycasting and impulse and you know I wouldn't expect a beginner to be able to understand something some of these Concepts someone that's never scripted before never done any sort of coding before and plus Bob is only 12 so I mean I'd be surprised but anyway this is what he's doing nothing wrong with it I mean maybe he's a child prodigy and maybe he's understanding some things okay so let's see what script is doing now so let's move over here and it looks like oh looks like now I've started watching a scripting tutorial from future me so this is 12-year-old me watching a tutorial from 21-year-old me let's just make that make sense in any case he has started learning to code so he's just watching this video and now some more time is going to pass here's a sun so some more time is about to pass so now boom boom bo bo bo bo boom it's now about 12:00 all right so Bob is still watching some tutorials he still got his bubble gum and let's see what script is doing so oh script is no longer in his bed looks like he has the laptop open and it looks like he's still watching tutorial but it seems that he might have paused it and he's no longer in bed I wonder what he's up to hm well if we look over here we can see oh he's over here and oh okay he looks like he's in this computer not not this computer isn't anything super powerful it looks like it's pretty it's a pretty standard computer and it looks like he is looking at ROBLOX Studio this looks like a really old version of Roblox Studio okay so it looks like script is looking at ROBLOX studio and maybe he's just thinking about how it works maybe he's trying to learn some things on his own so he's not even started he hasn't even started coding yet he's just looking at ROBLOX studio and looks like he's just trying to make sense of what all of this is so for example he's looking at the toolbox like what is this this what happens if I click this and then he's looking up here he's like huh okay there's so many different buttons I can click here I've never used anything like this before I see some explored thing here I see some properties here and I see all of this stuff here and I see the game over here now script hasn't used this before so he's just trying to get a hold of everything he's just trying to point out like what does he see what does he wonder he's trying to understand Roblox Studio before he understands scripting okay so now some time is going to pass so here we are okay we're going to see the sky get darker and okay the moon is out okay where is everyone all right so let's look over here oh looks like script is no longer using the computer looks like he has he's probably gone to sleep let's go find out oh would you look at that script is actually sleeping and as you can see from his eyes they're closed he seems to be happy and he's sleeping now it's actually pretty late let's actually look at what Bob is doing oh wow Bob is still awake still chewing that bubble gum or maybe it's a new one I don't know but as you can see Bob is still trying to learn it seems he's still on his computer and it seems that the passing of time does not affect him he's just trying to learn he's still watching YouTube now let's actually see what Bob is doing so it looks looks like looks like my man Bobby boy is looking at a video on how he can animate death so this is actually a video on the animation editor and it looks like he's starting to learn about animation it seems like Bob is probably it seems that Bob is probably really really far ahead of script who's sleeping right here I mean this guy is sleeping this guy is over here watching a video on the animation editor huh maybe this guy's already learned all of scripting no doubt that Bob is a hard worker he's watching tutorials he's thinking about how he can impress his friends by creating animations and then using them in his games well we have someone that is very very lazy look at this lazy bum over here he is sleeping how could you be sleeping at a time like this you've got scripting to learn well I guess only time will tell right so looks like we're going to have to wait it out and let's look over here and another day is going to pass and actually what's happening is seven days are passing by right before our eyes seven days are going by just like that and now that a week has passed by it's going to be interesting to see what they're up to all right so now that a week has passed let's see what they're up to so over here we can see that no one is sleeping so that means that script must be doing something on his computer and it looks like he is he's over here look whoa he started to script seven days later this guy has actually started to code in Roblox it looks like he's actually doing something with that knowledge so it looks like he's watching some YouTube videos and then he's starting to code a little bit now let's see what Bob is up to I mean this guy he must like he must have won the Nobel Prize by now right I mean he was watching a whole lot of tutorials he must have known what he was doing looks like he's just starting to catch up with scripting looks like he's just starting to he's getting his handles on scripting so let's look at Bob whoa those eyes are humongous what happened to your gum okay so unfortunately Bob has run out of bubble gum that may or may not be a bad thing but let's see what he's doing so let's actually have a look seven ways to make 1 million Robo wow this guy is living the dream this guy must have he he must have already learned how to code he must be way better than him over here who's still getting a grasp on scripting this guy's learning seven ways to make a million robox this guy must have wow I mean I'm impressed Bob must have finished coding multiple games by now and he must be learning about the Roblox algorithm or something because now he's he's obviously set his sights a lot higher than just coding now he's trying to make money with it and a million Robux is $3,500 so this guy must be wow he has big dreams and I hope he gets it so now time is passing time pass time pass and it's night time and actually multiple days are going to pass let's actually say that a month is now passing so now as you can see there's a day and night cycle all right so a month has finally just passed it's currently 11:00 all right let's see what they're up to so it looks like it looks like script is coding so we're just going to let him cook and and let's look at what Bob is doing whoa Bob you seem upset what happened Bob seems absolutely worried what is he looking at is he like playing a horror game or something what he's looking at Studio Bob is this a new game I mean you've clearly made a lot of progress right right Bob no script no I haven't made any progress at all but what what what do you mean what do you mean you haven't made any progress at all I thought you you were just coding a whole bunch of games I spent all of my time watching YouTube tutorials and I didn't learn anything at all Bob that's what you were doing this whole time you were just watching tutorials yes I was only watching tutorials and I thought I was learning but I wasn't learning anything oh you mean you watched all of those Tut tutorials for the entire month and you just opened studio uh yeah oh okay well I mean Bob I don't know what to tell you you got to learn this stuff man you can't just watch videos watching videos on it doesn't mean you're learning it I know I know all right well I think it's better if we just leave these guys alone and we look at the time all right so now an entire year is passing by things are moving really quickly can't wait to see what they're up to all right so looks like script oh wow script looks like he's got his first game out would you look at that he seems that seems like he's got flying mechanics lock on camera a custom Mouse icon health bars he's got everything wow and he looks happy he looks happy he's got his first game out now let's actually look at Bob let's hopefully his situation has improved a little bit since last time oh wow Bob you look happy you look very happy what happened did did you figure it out I mean I don't really see a laptop but did you figure it out oh yeah I figured out the scripting is not right for me I figured out that that isn't really my thing and I just kind of stepped away from it oh okay okay I understand I mean scripting isn't for everyone so that's totally fine all right fast forward several several years later so now years are passing by a lot of time is passing by let's see what happens all right so now a ton of years have passed by and it looks like there's a school now huh okay so now we're going to actually look at what's going on inside the school oh whoa that's that's that's Bob but that's Bob and script in the same exact class and wa what is that that looks like a really fancy laptop this is a MacBook Pro and here's Bob looks like Bob is looking at script's screen and script is smiling away looking at something I wonder what it is looks like script now has a laptop upgrade and Bob is looking at script screen hm let's actually see what they're up to whoa whoa whoa hang on hang on what is this whoa this is this is a new game this is Battle me and it looks like Bob is looking at battlemania it looks like Bob is looking at battl Mania and he seems very interested and script is just as happy as ever oh my god did you make that I sure did this is this is my new game all right so some more time has pass and let's actually see what they're up to whoa so now there's actually a few people here and it looks like everyone is looking and they're all checking out script's game and it seems that they all want to play his game and here's Bob let's actually talk to Bob whoa I didn't know you could do that I want to learn a script too later that day so let's follow Bob and let's see where he is right now so no one's really sleeping in this bed looks like Bob is now oh now Bob is actually he's on a computer he's on a PC and and it looks like Bob is actually starting to use studio so after all of those years Bob is finally starting to use Studio I wonder where script is now H whoa script now has his own personal setup and everything and I assume this is because he committed to scripting for so long that he's able to afford all this stuff so as you can see both script and Bob both start started in a place where they wanted to learn the script but the outcome ended up very very different for both of them so why did things end up the way they did Bob made the big mistake and script didn't the first smaller mistake that Bob made is that he started with the goal of wanting to impress others but in the end script was the one that did all the impressing Bob was actually impressed by Script the initial goal that Bob had of wanting to impress others is called extrinsic motivation and what extrinsic motivation basically is is that he was motivated by something that was outside of his control like getting praised by his friends but script's goal was to be able to script anything that he wanted which is an example of intrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation means that he was motivated by his own desires that were deep within himself he had the drive to learn to script because scripting itself is enjoyable and rewarding so the first lesson is that you should learn to script because you like the act of scripting itself not because you're just chasing something like fame money or status now a fun fact is that intrinsic motivation is way stronger than extrinsic motivation the fame money and Status will eventually come if you stick with it for long enough but if the very reason that you want to learn scripting is because of those things it's going to be harder for you to stick with it for the long run so the lesson here is that you should try to make the act of scripting itself be the main thing that motivates you the main M biggest mistake is that Bob had information overload because he spent all of his time watching tutorials and not actually scripting script however jumped right into studio and began scripting right away and he kept improving over time while Bob on the other hand wasn't even able to start scripting much because he just kept watching video after video after video and never really did anything in studio the main issue is distraction when you're watching YouTube videos online you end up finishing one and immediately starting another because YouTube recommends really interesting videos so if you want the best chance of sticking with scripting over the long term and becoming one of the greats you have to eliminate this distraction one way you can do this is by getting off of social media and learning it somewhere else like with my beginner's guide to Roblox scripting book this book teaches you how to script from the very beginning with every line of code fully explained to you and guess what there are literally quizzes and practice exercises built inside the book so you know when you have to go into studio and actually practice it isn't like learning off of YouTube where there's tons of distractions left and right you just follow through the book do the quizzes and exercises and by the end you'll be able to script your own stuff if you're ready for your own copy check out the pinned Link in the comment section now another way you can eliminate distractions is by utilizing something called the Pomodoro Technique this is basically where you set a timer for 30 minutes and during those 30 minutes you can watch tutorials but the moment that timer stops you set another timer for 20 minutes and during those 20 minutes you go into studio and actually practice what you've learned then you do it again 30 minutes of tutorials 20 minutes of practice 30 minutes of tutorials 20 minutes of practice if you combine this technique with my book you will literally supercharge your learning if you found value in this video please make sure to like And subscribe I teach you how to become an awesome developer by telling stories just like the one you saw in this video I'll see you in the next video and be sure to comment which one do you think you're like right now are you more like Bob where you're just watching a bunch of tutorials and you're going to change the script or are you already like script where you're watching a few tutorials and then practicing it and then watching few tutorials and then practicing it see you later	17379	t	This content addresses the critical developer pain point of 'tutorial hell' and inefficient learning paths, providing

Well, I will solve that today with a premium and the safest option along with a free but still a safe option. But before we get to the tutorial, you will need to turn off your anti virus. And I know you might be saying, >> "It sounds suspicious. Why am I being asked to turn off my anti virus?" >> But it's because Windows detects a false positive while downloading any executor, but it's not actually dangerous. So once you have done that, let's get into it. Step one, download Wave from here and install the Bootstrapper. Step two, get a license from the first link in the description and register into your installed Bootstrapper. Step three, open Roblox and enjoy exploiting. Wave is the best because it has tons of OP features. This cloud script hub helps you find the script for any game you may choose. And then we got this AI chatbot which solves all your questions like a pro. Here is some cool gameplay of Wave. So you know its power. Wave also has the highest UNC and Sunn C meaning it has the highest execution power which lets you execute anything without any crashes or flags. And that was the paid option. But if you want to enjoy a safe exploiting experience without being banned, let me teach you how to do so. Step one, download an emulator of your choice, but I recommend LD Player or Moon Player. Android users can skip this step. Step two, open the emulator and inside it, go here and click Android to download this file. Step three, open Roblox and join your favorite game. And you will see the codeex UI pop up. And that's all. Now find the script from the cloud script hub and execute it to enjoy. Anyways, all the links you will need are in the description.	1786	f	The content targets players looking for game exploits and third-party executors, which contradicts the interests of Roblox developers who seek to secure their games and prevent cheating.	{"Roblox executor","Roblox exploits 2025","Wave executor","Roblox script hub","Codex executor","Roblox mobile exploits"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N

JyvZDPgcHjM	Mastering This Gives You HACKS In Scripting	Ludius	10755	5:24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyvZDPgcHjM	roblox scripting tutorial	there is one key thing that once you know how to use it you literally feel like you've just unlocked hacks for scripting once I mastered this thing I was able to go from barely being able to code a rock paper Caesars game to being able to code a full combat game this thing is so simple that you'll be able to use it right after this video I'll not only be revealing what it is but also showing you how to use it to your advantage if you're a starter scriptor this is your chance to find some valuable information because literally back in the day nobody told me how to use this I had to figure it out my own okay so what is this hat you might be asking yourself I'll tell you what this hack is but first let me tell you a quick story there was a time just a couple of years ago in 2022 where I was completely stuck on scripting I felt that I could only do simple things each time I try to do something more ambitious it would just turn out very very buggy at best most of the time I tried something Advance it didn't even work as expected at all naturally frustration started to slow slowly consumed me up until the point it was turning into anger yes I would have loved to throw my computer out the window at this point so if you're someone that feels that you need to punch your computer with all your mind just know you're not alone so how did I come out of this situation well through trial and error I found one thing literally just one thing that I didn't have that was greatly hindering my progress all right now what was this thing it's having the ability to debug I've actually noticed that debugging has huge value for scriptors and if you don't know what debugging is simply P debugging is a process that allows you to locate precisely where the error is so that you can fix it I know it sounds complicated but it's actually super easy in N9 out of 10 cases for this you want to use the good old prints yes I'm talking about the normal prints so when you're coding you have your script which is a bunch of lines of code right and sometimes you have a bunch of scripts that are connected with each other for the example I'm about to give you I just made a script that's supposed to make your character invisible once you touch that red part as you can see I'm touching the red part but my character is not going invisible now 2021 and early 2022 me would have just said huh I wonder why it's not working and start going through the script over and over and over again and if I was lucky I'd find the error now what most good scriptors will do is they'll add a bunch of prints throughout the whole script and see how much of the code actually runs and how it runs for example add a print saying touched at the start of the touch event and one at the end saying touched to then add one after the if humanoid saying humanoid found after this add a print before it Loops through all the character Parts saying about to Loop so right about here okay now add a print in the loop saying turned vaa name invisible which will tell you what part of the character just turned invisible R15 has 15 parts so it should print 15 different parts right and then at at a print after the loop saying Loop ended okay so what do we have here so each time the part is touched it will print touched and then if it finds the humanoid inside the parent of what it just touched it will print found humanoid then it will get the character and then print about to Loop right before it starts looping right after that every Loop is going to turn the part invisible and print that that part just turned invisible so you'll know it's looping right and then after that's done it's going to print Loop ended so you know the loop has ended and in the end after all of that's done it's going to print touched to now let's test again as you can see it says touched and then it immediately says touched to without any other prints we' said in the middle and it's not even printed the found the humanoid we put right after the if statement what does this mean it means that the script jumps from here to here now usually when this happens especially when an if statement is in the middle is because the requirement is not met so let's try checking what the requirements are there's just one requirement it says if humanoid okay so if it finds what humanoid is so what is humanoid in the script so humanoid is equal to character colon find first child humanoid but as you might be able to see it has a space in the end so the script didn't find any instance inside the character called the humanoid with a space in the end so you got to remove that space I had a typo and that's why the if statement didn't run fix that remove that space test again and okay works perfectly awesome right this will let you know exactly where your error is because you will instantly notice what part of the script is not running when you don't see the print that is meant for that specific part of the script it's very easy to understand right if you master debug in you'll be able to fix almost anything easily trust me all right man that's what I got for today bro I'm telling you if you're not using this don't slip on this and also very very good video coming out on Friday so stay tuned for that anyways keep leveling up bro be safe and I'll see you when I see you peace	5330	t	The content addresses the fundamental developer pain point of debugging

GXzXoxPmZB8	I Learned Roblox SCRIPTING In Only 7 Days	OmegaDev	5597	4:24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXzXoxPmZB8	roblox scripting tutorial	so a few years ago I was looking at games on Roblox until I got the idea to make my own game but there's one issue I don't know how it script so I decided to spend the next 7 Days learning how script so I can make a Roblox game starting off on day one I decided to find some videos and after a couple of hours I made it pretty far into Alvin Block's scripting series now at this point I was getting ready to end day one but I came across another video by album blocks which looked interesting so here's a timelapse of that now at this point I was done the map and I thought it was looking pretty good however I still need this script and after some time I finished the first script what it does is guess the player when they join and then guess the player's character and changes some properties within the character hemoid then the script will Loop through the player list every second and if the player's character exists it'll add one jump power to the player's humanoid now at this point all I have left to do was make a UI and script it so it shows the player's jump power and just like that I was done and I was ready to test the game and it didn't work so I went to the output and went to the script that had the ear and it was pretty obvious what I needed to be delete it but for some reason I decided to add an extra equal sign I guess not even my pebr follow simple tutorials anyways as soon fixed the script and the game was working now at this point I decid to end day one as May losss of progress which brings us to day two to start off the second day I decided to watch some more scripting videos so I continued watching alen Block's scripting series and after a couple of hours I made lots of progress anyways day three is when things got interesting since I created the scripting test real which is where I planned on storing the rest of the projects I worked on throughout the rest of the challenge after I started watching a video by a cyber career on click detectors and after some scripting I made it so some properties of the ball changes whenever you click on it but for for some odd reason I started humping the ball anyways I soon got back to scripting and made it so that whenever you hover over the ball the transparency of the ball changes to 0.5 once I go back to scripting I decided to make my own function so I started working on a function that would spawn apart at a random position in the sky whenever he right click the ball now for some reason I didn't put local in front of the variables and instead put them in the parameters of the function but don't worry because I fixed my mistake and surprisingly there's no errors with the function I then made it so that whenever a player touches the ball it print the name of the player that touched it and just like that it was day four on day four I came across two videos B Mo events made by gnome code and the dev King I then spent the next hour trying to get remote events to work but I encountered lots and lots of bugs well there was only two bugs but they were still bugs anyways I finally fixed the bugs and the remote V was working so whenever I press you the transparency of the part would change I didn't start watching another video by gnome call making a shift to Sprint system and just like that it was working and I was zooming around the the map the last thing I did for day four was started watching a video by it's Floppy Fish on making Jui hover effects however I was starting to get tired so I only made the base ji now at this point you're probably expecting day five but I was extremely busy so I wasn't able to get any work done on day five and day six however although I was still busy on day seven I was only able to start working once the challenge had officially ended which was at 400 p.m. but I wanted to at least finish the Jui effects so I started working on a script that had two functions which would control the ji size I then assigned each function to the most enter mouse Le function so that whenever you hover your mouse over the ji it size will increase by 1.1 and the ji was working I then started eying on to the two functions so that the color of the button would change whenever your mouse hovered over it and then mixed up the colors so the button turns red whenever your mouse stops hovering over it when it's supposed to do the opposite I then went back to the script again to fix my mistake and add some sound effects which will play whenever your mouse is hovering over the button however I want to have my own twist so I started working on jump scare that will have a one in 10 chance of playing whenever the player clicked the button anyways Here's the final product well that is going to be it for this video and I do apologize for having nothing to show for day five and D6 but anyways thanks for watching and consider subscribing if you enjoyed the video and I'll see you all next time peace	4922	t	This content effectively maps out a beginner's learning path for Roblox scripting,

foKFpXZYXPk	How to use module scripts on Roblox	Roblox Learn	84083	5:42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foKFpXZYXPk	roblox scripting tutorial	Have you ever found yourself copying and pasting a chunk of code from one script to another? Well, what if I told you that there was a better solution to this? Introducing module scripts. Hey there, this is Steven. Let's learn something new. At the core, module scripts allow you to reuse code between different scripts. So, why even care? Well, when you duplicate a piece of your code, it becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain. If you make a change to one duplicate, you need to remember to make a change in the other. What if you forget? Or what if another team member doesn't know to do this? This sounds like a recipe for hard to find bugs. Avoiding duplicate code leads to code bases that are easier to maintain. Okay, so wouldn't you use a module script? Well, essentially, anytime you find yourself duplicating code across various scripts, that's a great time to break the duplicate code out into its own module script. Let's look at an example to learn how to use module scripts. What we see on screen right here is just a little simple windmill spinning around. And if we look inside the script here, we see it's it's quite simple, but I wanted to pay attention to the speed variable here. Right now, it's set to 10. And let's say we wanted to duplicate this windmill a few times. So now we've got a bunch of windmills in our game. But what if we wanted to change the speed? Unfortunately for us, we would have to go through and change the speed variable within each and every windmill script. But let's try to use module scripts to make this a lot easier for ourselves. Under replicated storage, I'm going to create a new module script and name it windmill config. We'll copy that name and we'll change the module variable here to be windmill config as well to match the name. So you can see the core of a module script is simply just a normal script, but it returns a value. And that's the most important part about a module script is that it returns one and only one value. Not zero, not many, just one value. And it can be any value that's valid within Lua. So it could be a number, it could be a string. Most commonly, you're going to see people use tables and functions. In this case, we have a table called windmill config. And inside of this, let's create a variable called speed. And we'll set it to 10, just like we had it set before within our windmill spin script. Now, let's implement this module script into our windmill script. Let's go back to just one windmill and open up the spin script. Again, we see the speed variable there, but we want to replace that and use the windmill config instead. So, in order to grab the value from a module script, we use the require function. and we will give it a path to our module script. Now, when we do that, we're going to grab this value. The return statement of our module script is going to be what we capture within our windmill config variable right here. So, we can get rid of the speed variable here and we will replace its usage in our heartbeat function with windmill config.speed. We'll run our game again and we'll see that it still works. So, that's good. So once again, let's duplicate our windmill a bunch of times. But this time, if we want to change the speed of the windmills, all we have to do is go to our windmill config and change this value one time. So let's change it to a speed of two to slow it down. And now we see all of our windmills have responded and they're spinning a lot slower. Another really important note about module scripts is that they only get executed one time per environment that they're in. So in this case, we're running everything on the client. And so our module script runs once on the client and then it caches the return value. What that means is that even though we have a bunch of windmills that are requiring this windmill config module, it's only running this code one time and then caching this windmill config value that we're returning. So they all have access to the exact same value. This also means that we can modify this value from another script and all of our windmills will respond accordingly. So for instance, let's create a script within the workspace here and we'll change it to our client run context to match the same context as our windmill. And going back to our spin script, we'll just copy the windmill config and replicated storage lines and paste it into our script here in the workspace. And then let's just create a little loop that every frame sets the windmill config speed value to some noise value. Okay, let's hit play and see what happens. Look at that. We see that the speed of all the windmills is changing and they're all changing in sync because they all share the exact same windmill config table which we're modifying from our script in the workspace. Another use case of module scripts that we see often is to use them as a collection of functions. So for instance, I have a table util module script here that contains a couple functions that I reuse a lot. I have the map function and the filter function. And while the implementations might look a little crazy here with all their types, the important part is that they are stored within a module script. So at any given point in time, I can grab these functions and use them from another script. And that's it for now. If you want to learn more about module scripts, visit the Roblox Creator Hub page and search module scripts to find more documentation on what they are and how they work.	5512	t	The content addresses the fundamental developer challenge of code maintenance and duplication by providing a clear, practical demonstration of Roblox module scripts and the require function.	{"Roblox module scripts","Luau require function","Roblox code reuse","Roblox scripting tutorial","DRY principle Roblox","Roblox windmill script","module script return value"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	[{"apis": ["ModuleScript", "require"], "problem": "Reuse code between different scripts to avoid duplication and maintenance errors", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["ModuleScript", "ReplicatedStorage", "require"], "problem": "Centralize configuration values for multiple game objects", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["ModuleScript", "require"], "problem": "Synchronize shared state or variables across multiple scripts in the same environment", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "intermediate", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["RunService.Heartbeat", "require"], "problem": "Modify shared module values dynamically at runtime to affect multiple listeners", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "intermediate", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["ModuleScript"], "problem": "Organize reusable utility functions into a library", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "intermediate", "automatable": false}]	Module scripts for code modularity and shared state management	f	\N	\N

-QSmtYVMRH4	How to make your FIRST Roblox Game in 2024-2025 (Make Robux)	CodeBro29	2207521	29:49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QSmtYVMRH4	roblox scripting tutorial	By the end of this video, if you follow all the steps that I'm going to be showing you, you will learn how to make this game by yourself. You're going to learn how to make an obby, and you're going to learn how to make Robux with this obby by adding a skip stage button where people can actually purchase this from you. And once they purchase it, they will actually get skipped to the next stage and you can earn Robux that way. Let's not waste any time. Let's just jump right into this. Enjoy, guys, and good luck. All right. To get started on your game making journey, you're going to have to go to roblox.com/create and you're going to be brought to this page. After that, click this big start creating button and it's going to check to see if you have Roblox Studio. If not, it'll ask you to download Studio. Go ahead and click this button and then move on. Once you've downloaded Roblox Studio, you can go ahead and double tap the app to open it up. And now you should actually be inside of Roblox Studio. I'm going to be showing you some of these windows right now. So, the first one is the new window. This will create new games for you. So you can go ahead and click new and that'll show you all the different templates you can use to create your games. The next one is going to be my games. This tab holds all your current games that you have made. So once you've already made a game, you can check in here to see where those games are. Recent shows you the most recent games you've been working on. After that, there's archive and tour, but we're not going to touch on those. So go ahead and go to the new tab and click this base plate button. That's going to give you a brand new game with a Roblox base plate. First thing we're going to do is learn how to move around and navigate through this 3D space. You can use W and D on your keyboard to move around just like you can in a Roblox game. Next, you can hold right click and move your mouse around, and that'll pan your camera. So, go ahead and hold right click and move your camera, and you can figure out how this camera system works. Takes a little bit of getting used to, but once you figure it out, it's easy peasy. Next, you can move around your mouse and hover over different objects in your game, and you can leftclick to select them. For example, I just selected the spawn location. If for whatever reason that's not working, head up here to this select button. Click that first, and then you can select tools or objects in your game. Okay, the next thing we're going to learn is how to navigate the different tabs. Right now, we are in the home tab, and you can see that up here at the top of my screen. It says home. This has a ton of different buttons. We're only going to get into a few of them. Uh, but first there, let's do move, scale, select, and rotate. If you select a part, you are using the select tool right here. Now, if you switch over to the move tool, you can actually move parts in your 3D world. So, as you can see, there are three different axes that we can move it on. There's the X, the Y, and the Z. So, we can use these arrows to drag around our objects in different dimensions in the three-dimensional world. And you can drag it all around and around and around. Okay. Next is the scale button. You can click that and then click a part. and you're going to see very similar things, but instead of arrows, it's just dots or circles. If you drag one of those, you can see it moves or it resizes it along that axis. So, we can go ahead and resize it this way. We can resize it this way. Okay. And last but not least, we have rotate. If you click the rotate button and you click something, you can rotate your parts. Uh, and you can rotate them whichever way you would like. There again, three ways because this is three dimensions. Okay. If you What if you want to undo all that though? Glad you asked. You can go ahead and hit control or command if you're on a Mac and Z. So you can do that as many times as you need and that will undo what you've done. As you can see, I've just clicked control-z a ton of times and now my spawn location is back to where it started. If you want to redo something, you can either click this arrow right here or you can click control shift Z and that'll redo what you just did. But I'm going to hit control-z again cuz I want my spawn location to stay right here. Next, there's the toolbox. this. If you click this, it'll open up with the toolbox window right here. These are all different free models that people and Roblox have provided uh for you to use in your games. Be careful though, a lot of them have hacks that will ruin your game. So, really be careful with what you choose in the toolbox. Next, we can insert parts. If you click this part right here, you'll see a new part has been added to our game. And we can move this around and around and around. Uh we can also add, if you click this little triangle under the part, you can choose a different part to add. For example, if I want a sphere, there we go. I have a sphere. Now, we can also go ahead and head over to this color right here. If we click this, maybe we want to make the sphere red. So, we can click the sphere, click this color, and change the color to red just by clicking the right color from here. Now, you'll notice if I click it now, it's not going to do anything, and that's because I don't have the sphere selected. Once I click the sphere, then I can change the color. Okay. Uh, after that, let's go ahead and delete these by clicking clicking them and clicking backspace or delete. That will go ahead and delete the parts in your game. The next thing, what if you get a part lost in your game? So, you can actually go ahead and insert another part. And let's say it's way over here and you want to go over to that without having to scroll all the way. Um, or use WD. That's another thing. You can scroll to move faster. If you scroll in, uh, you can move closer. And if you scroll out, you can move further away. But let's say that you're all the way over here and you want to just quickly go over there. Well, you can select it by dragging like a box over the part you want to go to and click F. and that'll focus your camera onto the part that you just selected. Okay, so now that we have all that down, I'm gonna select this part and go ahead and hit backspace again. Okay, another thing that you should know as we are getting into this is how to uh open other windows such as the explorer and properties. So, if you go ahead and hit view right here at the top, you can go ahead and click explorer and properties. Make sure that these two windows are open. You should see explorer and properties. And then let's just quickly go ahead and show you what this does. Uh you can select a part and uh you can find it in the explorer. So if you open up the workspace and you look in here, you should have something called part. You can click that part in the explorer and you can see now it's selected in the game. You can rename that part by clicking the name. And maybe we'll call this uh cube. And there we go. Now we have a part called cube inside of our game. Now if we want to change any of the properties, we can scroll down to the properties tab. So, if you click the part either in the explorer or in your game, you can mess with all these properties. You can change the color this way. You can change the transparency and all that. Uh, there's a lot you can do with this, but I'm just not going to get into that right yet because we're going to talk about that more once we start making the game. Okay, we are going to go ahead and now, as I've said that, start making our game because that's what you guys came here for. So, let's go ahead and now that you know how to move around studio, let's go ahead and make an awesome obby. So, uh, this is going to involve a little bit of scripting, a little bit of building, and, uh, a little bit kind of a little bit of everything. So, let's just go ahead and get started. Uh, and I'm just going to walk you through step by step everything you need to know, and by the end of the game or end of the video, you'll have made the game that I just showed you at the beginning. Okay? So, go ahead and select this base plate in the explorer and delete it. So, uh, if you missed that, make sure you go into the explorer, find this part called base plate, click it, and click backspace. That'll delete your base plate. Now, you can see we just have a spawn point. Okay, I'm going to insert one of those cartoony outlines to our uh our spawn location. So, the way you do that is by selecting the spawn location either in your game or in the explorer tab. Then, you can click this little plus icon right here. And you're going to search for a highlight. That's this object right here. You can go ahead and click that. Next thing to do is click that highlight. And I'm going to go ahead and change this fill transparency to one. That way there's it doesn't make our uh spawn location a weird color. So right here in the properties, fill transparency, set that to one right here. And then you can change this outline color by clicking the color right here and changing it to a black. If you're on a Windows, it might look a little different. And then hit okay. And there you go. Now there's this cartoony outline to your spawn pad. As you can see, it's it's going all the way around. Perfect. So, that's just a little touch to make it look a little bit fancier. Now, let's go ahead and make stage one. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to insert a sphere into the game. And this sphere is going to be um the uh first object for players to climb on. So, I'm going to go ahead and redo that really quick so you guys can see everything I just did. Go ahead and come up here to the part, click the drop down, and click sphere. Now you have a sphere right here. You can click it and you can move it away from the spawn location. You can also go ahead and scale it and you can recolor it if you want. There we go. The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to click that and I'm going to click controll D. That will duplicate this part. And as you can see now we have two parts in our explorer. Now we can click this move button and let's just move it out like this. And there we go. Now we have a second sphere. We can recolor this one as well. And we're just going to make a little ball jump obby. Okay. So, let's go ahead and do this again. Crl D to duplicate it. Click the move tool and move it around. Then recolor it. Ctrl D. Move with the move tool and recolor it. Ctrl D. Move with the move tool and recolor it. Okay. So, you may be thinking, I want to test this out. Hold your horses though. We got to fix something real quick. So, if you go ahead and play this game now, I'm just going to show you. Don't go ahead and play it right now. But if you play it right now, you're going to notice that all your spheres are going to disappear. And uh well, where did they go? Turns out they fell. They fell all the way through the map. Um that means that if I go ahead and select these, I'm going to just visualize what happened when I hit play. All these spheres just went boop down. Okay. So, if you want to fix that from happening, you're going to need to anchor these. So you can click each of these parts and you can click this button up here that says anchor or you can scroll down in the properties and make sure anchored is checked. I would personally just go ahead and select the sphere and click this anchor button up here. If you want to select more than one part at a time, you can hold shift. So if I hold shift and I select all three of these now you can see all three of them are selected and I can hit anchor and that'll anchor all these at the same time. Okay, let's go ahead and hit play now. And we should see that the spheres have stayed in the air. And yep, there they are. Right now, uh, we can go ahead and play this game. Let's jump, jump, jump, jump, and jump. Oh, I'm terrible at obies, so I missed that last one. But there you go. There is stage one. Okay. So, uh, we're going to go ahead and do a little scripting, though, because what we want to do is we want to have checkpoints. So, I'm going to insert another part. Uh, we're going to just insert a part. Uh, let's do it the way that we've been doing it. So, click this drop down and click block. Now, let's go ahead and move this to the end of the ball jump and we can go ahead and change the color of this. I'm going to make it a green so that people know this is a checkpoint and I'm going to go ahead and scale it way up like this. Here is our checkpoint. Make sure to anchor it now. And I'm going to go ahead and click it and click the materials right here in the properties tab. Go ahead and click that and select neon. that will make your part glow and people will be able to know, okay, that's my checkpoint. So, let's go ahead and click this part and where it's highlighted in the explorer, let's rename it by clicking the name and naming this checkpoint. Okay, next thing you want to do is click this plus icon on the checkpoint and insert a int value. Okay, so click the the plus, search for int value and insert this by clicking it. Okay, once you have one, go ahead and rename it to stage. Okay, this is going to be the current stage that they're on. So, if they press if they step on this block, we're going to set their stage to be two. So, inside of the properties of this stage, go ahead and set zero to two right here. So, that will mean, okay, once we hit this block, we're going to be on stage two. Okay. Now, because this isn't my beginner scripting series, I'm going to go ahead and do the scripting. And I'll leave the script in the description. So go ahead and what you're going to do is you're going to click this plus on the checkpoint. You're going to hover over our checkpoint, click a plus, and then search for script and insert this one. Not a local script, not a module script, but a regular script. Okay. And then you can rename this if you want. Uh I'm going to rename it to checkpoint script. Totally up to you though. And then I'm going to have this uh code in the description. So this script is going to be in the description. Make sure you look in the description for checkpoint script and then copy and paste this into the script. So go ahead and get rid of the print hello world at the top. The way you would do that is just by selecting it and uh and just clicking backspace. So you can drag your mouse. You can click and drag and then click backspace. Okay. And go ahead and paste this code into the script. Now you can close out of the script by clicking this X right here on the checkpoint script. There we go. Now we're out of the script. The next thing is to add a leader script. Uh, and again, this is going to be down in the description. Just a quick reminder though, if you have any trouble at all with this video or any of the tutorials on my channel, make sure to join my Discord server and ask the community uh how to solve your problem. There's a channel called scripting support and you can add ask any questions in there um or studio support. So, you can ask any questions in there uh and you can help get an answer quick and we can help you with an answer as quick as we can. Okay. Uh go ahead and in your explorer hover over server script service. You'll find it right here. And you can go ahead and click the plus and again add another script. Not a lo local script or a leader I mean a mod module script. You can rename this script to leader stats if you want. And then you're going to paste the second link or second code second script uh into this. So go down into the description and look for leader stats script next. You can paste it here. Okay. Okay. So, go ahead and copy and paste this script from the description into the uh into this new script. Uh and then you can click the X up here to close out of it. Then you can go ahead and hit this play button right here, this blue triangle. Uh it'll be next to your color. And then you can hit play and that'll spawn you into your game. So, let's go ahead and hit play. And as you can see, if you spawn in and you've done everything correctly so far, you should see this up in the corner. You should see your stage right here. And as you can see, it says I'm on stage one. But if we go ahead and complete the obby, if we go ahead and go all the way to the end and step on this, you can see that our stage is going up. Now, you can see that there's obviously a bug right now. I'll have that fixed for you. You guys don't need to worry about that at all. So, um, that should be fixed for you. That's just for me. And just to show you that I was telling the truth, I'm going to go ahead and complete this. And you can see that this bug has been fixed. There you go. Stage two. This should be fixed for you. You can just copy and paste the script in the description like I told you to. And uh there you go. Now, let's go ahead and add some more stages. Um but before we do that, actually, I need to make sure that players spawn where they're supposed to spawn when they die. So, uh let's go ahead. I'm going to go ahead and show you how to do that. Uh it's going to involve another script. So, in the workspace, go ahead and hover over workspace. Click the plus. Okay. And then insert a folder. You can search for that and insert a folder. Name this folder. This is super important. Name this folder spawns. And you can again do that either by clicking the name or you can go into the properties and change the name right here. Okay. The next thing you're going to need to do is click this checkpoint. Click it again. Left click it. And then drag it up to the spawns and then release it once the checkpoint is on top of spawns. That will put the checkpoint right here. This checkpoint inside of our spawns folder. This is super super important. So, make sure that you do that. Uh, and if you didn't get that, just rewatch that part of the video. Um, so make sure you have spawns folder and a checkpoint in there. Okay. Next, insert a script again into server script service. And you can rename this um, respawn script. Again, this will be in the description. Just look in the description for what says respawn script and paste it into here. So, go ahead and paste this code into the script. close out of it again by clicking X and hit play to test out your obby so far. If you go ahead and go past the uh the spheres, you can jump on top of them. And then if we hit the checkpoint, you'll see our stage is up to stage two. We can jump off and once we die, we should respawn on our checkpoint. And as you can see, yep, here I am on my checkpoint. All right, just a quick reminder. If you want to learn how to make these scripts for yourself and make your very very own Roblox games um without having to use YouTube tutorials, uh then make sure to go check out my beginner scripting series. I'll leave that linked down in the description. And uh yeah, it's uh it's hopefully going to be helpful to you. Okay, the next thing to do is to add more stages. So, uh I'm going to go ahead and let you guys go ahead and do this part, but I'm going to show you how. So, remember the toolbox earlier? Go ahead and open up the toolbox and search for obby. Okay. And in here you can see a ton of different options for your obies. Now again I I would be very very very careful with the um obby parts you insert. I would say make sure that when you hover over it, see these this little check mark, make sure that's green and it has a good amount of ratings. That means that a lot of people have uh have liked this and say it's a good model. Okay? Just just to keep you safe. Okay. So, how how can we actually go ahead and insert these? Well, you can go ahead and drag this into here. Okay. And now once you drag it on top of one of your other parts, you can see our our stage is right here. Now, I want to go ahead and move this so it's not in the middle of the other stages. So, I'm going to go ahead and click it. Click the move tool. And we can go ahead and move this out of the way like this. Okay. So, now we have our next stage of our obby. What we're going to do is we're going to click this checkpoint. We're going to duplicate it by clicking control D and we're going to move it to the end right here by clicking move. Okay, the next thing you need to do is to click this checkpoint and drop down. See where it's highlighted in the explorer. So find that. You can open up the spawns folder and open up your checkpoint and then change your stage to be three now. So click the stage inside of this checkpoint. So click the checkpoint, find stage right here, and click uh this value and change the two to be a three. So that'll tell my script that I have written for you guys, hey, now we're on stage three now that we've hit this button. And now you can go ahead and add as many stages as you want. I'm going to go ahead and add about two more. Okay. Now, you're going to get these pop-ups on some of these that say this includes scripts. This can be dangerous. So, if you want to be careful, go ahead and join my Discord server and just like ask, hey, do these scripts look good? Um, but I think some of some of them are okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and insert this one. I'm going to click okay. And I'm going to go ahead and rotate this. If you want to just rotate it 90°, you can hit CtrlR, and that will rotate a model 90° like that. And then we can click the move tool, and we can move it. Perfect. So, now we have our next stage. The next thing I'm going to do is click this checkpoint. I'm going to duplicate it by clicking Ctrl D. And I'm going to move it again. And once again, you need to click the checkpoint. You need to go into here into that checkpoint. Find the stage inside of that checkpoint. And now we're going to change it to four. And you can keep doing this for as many stages as you want. And if I go ahead and hit play, it's going to go ahead and Yep. There we go. So, we can go ahead and jump on these. And we're going to go into stage two. We can go across here. and we're going to get to stage three. Next, we can try and get past this. I'm not good at obies, though, so it probably won't happen. Um, but as you can see, once I die, I respawn at the checkpoint. And everything seems to be working just fine. Okay, perfect. So, and I can make it to Oh, I can't quite make it to the end of my hobby. That's okay. All right, the next thing I want to show you how to do is to make a skip stage button so that you can actually make Robux. But before we do that, I want to ask if this video has been helpful so far, if you would just quickly take a second out of your day to subscribe. It's completely free and you can always change your mind later. Now, let's get back to the video and help you make some Robux. And to do this, you're going to need to join my Discord server. What you're going to need to do is you're going to need to go to the announcements channel and click the pinned link or pinned uh button and then you're going to find the um the developer products script. Okay. So, uh, what we're going to do is we're going to create a, uh, GUI. Also, in my Discord server, I'll just include a file. So, uh, you can just drag that file into the game. So, if you go ahead and download that file from my Discord server, you can find the file on your computer and just drag it into here and it'll create that GUI for you. But if you want to make it by yourself, go ahead and hover over started GUI, click that plus icon, click screen GUI right here, and then you can click frame. Okay, you can move this frame by selecting it right here and um moving it around. Again, I'm do I'm going to do this quickly though because this is going to be available for free in my Discord server. You can move it around to where you like. Then I'm going to go ahead and click uh this make it a darker color like that by changing the background color. You can add a corner UI corner. Oops, sorry about that. UI corner. Click the UI corner and change this eight to be something like 30. That'll round this frame right here. Okay. And now I'm gonna go ahead and insert a text button into there. Text button. Okay. And here you can go ahead and scroll down. Find the size property in properties and change that to be 1, 0, 1, 0. That'll resize the button to fit the entire screen. Next, go ahead and click background transparency. Change that to one. Scroll down in the properties till you find text color. Select that and change it to a white. Hit okay. Next, change the font face to Froooko one right here. And click text scaled. And then we can change the text right here in the properties by and change it to skip stage. Okay. So now we have a skip stage button. I actually think I like it up at the top. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead go ahead and copy this again. Um, click your frame. Go down to the properties and click position. And you're going to go ahead and do point uh.5 comma 0 comma.1 comma 0. Actually 0 comma uh no uh that's right anchor point. So you can go ahead and click the frame, go to the properties, and click anchor point and set that to be 0.5 comma 0.5. Okay. And the next thing you're going to do is click the position right here. And you can set that to be 0.5 comma 0 comma 0.1 comma 0. That'll position it right here. Next thing to do is change the size. So click the size and set it to be 04 comma 0 comma 0.15 comma 0. There we go. There is our skip stage button. Uh, and it looks I think it looks fine. So, uh, you can go ahead and insert that. Uh, I'm trying to decide, should I have it on the top or the bottom? Maybe the bottom of the screen. So, I'm going to change this position to be 0.5 comma 0 comma 0.1 or 0.9 comma 0. There we go. Now, we have a skip stage button right here. Next thing to do is click that text label, uh, hover over it, click that plus icon, and click the local script. Okay. In that local script, you're going to paste the next line of code. This will also be linked down in the description. You don't have to join my Discord server for this. That's just if you want the model. Uh, and the model will include this script, by the way. So, if you want to just drag that model into your game, go ahead and join my Discord server and you can find it. But if not, just go ahead and go down to the description and paste this code. So, what you're going to do is you're going to copy and paste the script from the description. Look for uh dev product script local in the description, and you can paste that down there. The first thing you need to do is actually save your game. And this is a good idea to do kind of right away. Should have done this earlier. The way you're going to do this is by clicking file up in the top left. Click file. Click publish to Roblox. Then give it a name right here. We can just call this my first game. Then you can go ahead and click this create button right here. So once you publish it to Roblox, you should see this right here. Uh well, your game. And that means that it has successfully saved to Roblox. So, the next thing to do is open up Chrome or Safari or whatever web web browser you have, and you're going to type in create.roll.com. This is where you can make your developer product so you can actually earn Robux. Next, go ahead and click creations right here on your screen, and then find your game. My I named my game my first game right here. So, go ahead and click that and it's going to bring you to this next page. So, right here on this left side, scroll all the way down until you see uh uh sorry, developer products. Okay. So, go ahead and click developer products right there. And then click create a developer product. Next, go ahead and give it a name. We're going to call this skip stage. And go ahead and set how many how much Robux it should cost. So, we're going to go ahead. I'm going to set mine to be 20 Robux. Really cheap, but uh don't make it too expensive, otherwise people won't buy it. Then click create developer product. Okay. Next, what you can do is you can go ahead and click these three dots and click copy asset ID. You're going to need to do this for this step. So click that. And now let's head back to Roblox Studio. Okay. Once you're back in studio, go ahead and click starter GUI right here. Open up the screen GUI by clicking these triangles and the frame, the text button, and open the local script right here. Then you're going to paste all these zeros. You're going to select all those zeros, delete them, and you're going to paste that ID right there. Okay? So, make sure you copy you. This is your ID that you just copied in the last step. You're going to paste it there in that script where right before it says your ID here. And after you paste that ID right here, you can close out of your script and hit play. And we should actually be able to purchase our item. Okay. So, let's go ahead and come down here, click the skip stage button, and as you can see, it's asking us if we want to skip the stage. Um, just know this is a test purchase. Whenever you do it in Roblox Studio, uh, it won't actually charge your account. So, you can actually go ahead and buy it. But, you're going to notice, okay, it's actually not working. We're kind of scamming players right now. So, let's actually go ahead and fix that so that it teleports players to the next stage whenever they buy this. So to do that, go ahead and again hover over server script service and click the plus and insert a script. And for the last time, you're going to need to copy and paste one of the scripts from the description. Look for developer product server script down in the description and copy and paste that here. Okay, so you're going to go ahead and paste this script. Uh, and what you're going to need to do is you're going to then need to copy your developer product ID again. So close out of the script. Then you're going to scroll down to start a GUI screen GUI frame text button and the local script we were just in. Click this uh copy this number right here by hitting control copy. You can just select all this. Hit Ctrl + C. Then you can close out of the script again. Go to your new script and replace that ID right here, all these zeros with that. Okay, that's all you're going to need to do and you should have this working. I'm going to close out of the script and I'm going to rename this to uh skip stage. Okay, let's go ahead and hit play and test this out. So again, we are in Roblox Studio, so your account will not be charged for these. So you can actually go and test it yourself. Click the skip stage button and you can click this to actually purchase it. You hit okay and wait a couple seconds. And there you go. As you can see, I've just skipped to the next stage. And you can see my stage has also uh been changed up here in the leader stats. Now, really quickly, let's make your game public so that you can actually play it with your friends. Go ahead and head over to create.roll.com. Click this creations tab, and you're going to find your game again. Uh for me, it is my first game right here. You can go ahead and click that. Next, you can go ahead and go to uh settings under configure. Click public. That little dot right here. Make sure it's checked and click save changes. Now you can click overview over here again and then you can click view on Roblox and that'll open up your game in a brand new tab and you can join it here. You can copy this link right here, send it to your friends and you can have your friends join you and that's how you can uh publish it. Now everybody can play your Roblox game. And there you go. That is how you can make your own game. And I've also included how you can make Roblox in it too. If you have any questions, make sure to leave them in the comments below or join my Discord server. And if you want to just download download this entire game for yourself, you can go ahead and uh join my Patreon page. $5 a month that uh that tier will get you this game. Make sure to add as many stages as you want to this. Um all you have to do is just remember to click this checkpoint, your last one, duplicate it, move it, and then open up the checkpoint and change the stage value to whatever stage that starts. Okay. And uh there you go. That is how you can make your very first game in Roblox. Again, if you have any questions, make sure to let me know. Other than that, thank you guys so much for watching. Thank you to Samuel Ramsey and Snorlax for supporting me on Patreon. And uh other than that, I'll see you guys in the in a future video. Make sure to subscribe for more content like this.

vUN2cJD4mUk	How I Learned To Make Roblox Games in a Week	BinzuDev	1423255	39:39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUN2cJD4mUk	roblox scripting tutorial	should you learn how to make Roblox games is a question I've been wanting to answer in a video for a little while now however there was one small issue I don't actually know anything about Roblox so there was only one logical solution I challenged myself to learn the ins and outs of Roblox studio in only one week in this video I'll go over what I did on every day of the challenge and at the end I'll give my thoughts on the engine and I'll explain whether or not I think you should learn it depending on your skill level and goals and if you already know that you want to make Roblox games then hopefully you can learn from the tips I give as I explain my learning process but first I'd like to go over my history with Roblox up until now cuz you see I actually did play Roblox from around 20 9 to 2011 and while today Roblox has grown into this huge platform that's worth like a gazillion dollars back then things were a lot more simple now I was like 6 years old so my memory might be a little fuzzy but I think I remember playing a lot of games like obstacle courses natural disaster survival work at a pizza place which are still around today but not quite as popular and also back then there wasn't any smooth terrain everything was made out of well blocks it really just felt like playing with Legos but on the computer and it was really fun but I would eventually stop playing in 2011 when I discovered Minecraft and moved on to that without ever looking back and that was it for the next 12 years of my life I didn't play Roblox or really ever thought about it I knew it still existed I would hear about it from like memes and stuff but that was about it so when I made my intro to Game Dev video talking about Roblox never even crossed my mind so I was surprised when I got a comment asking why I didn't talk about Roblox and then I got another and another and another and another and I got a lot of comments asking about Roblox and I thought Roblox that's not really a game engine right and thus I embarked on a quest to learn more about Roblox over the course of 2023 I would discover just how much had changed in my 12 years of absence for one some of these games are actually really good and a few of them don't even look like they were made in Roblox it's actually insane it's no longer just Lego godod I can see why people call it a game engine the only problem is those good games are kind of rare and they're usually hidden under a mountain of lowquality games and in recent years Roblox seems to be having a lot of issues but I'm not here to talk about that instead I want to focus on the game development tool itself Roblox studio and find out if it's a good engine so why am I doing this well two reasons for one I've only ever made 2D single player games so the idea of making 3D multiplayer games was really exciting and two I actually have a game idea that I think would be a nice fit for Roblox so I thought I could try to make it after the challenge that is because I'm going to follow my own advice I will not learn the engine just to make a game instead I'll make a game to learn the engine so I tossed my game idea aside for the time being all right now that this is finally out of the way we can get on with the challenge starting with and life you have ROBLOX so day one I opened Roblox studio and went in the default starting place I completely ignored the built-in tutorial and instead had my friend Ekko show me the basics I learned to move around and select stuff then move scale and rotate objects then he showed me the marketplace where you can choose from an endless amount of user generated assets and put them directly in your projects for Better or For Worse you'll see what I mean as a test I grabbed the Santa model and I tried to see how big I could make it turns out you can make things really big then I tried using the smooth terrain feature which is all right I didn't end up using it a whole lot so I don't have much to say about it but it looks nice then I learned about roblox's team create feature which allows for multiple people to edit the same game at the same time which is honestly really impressive like I think that's really cool I don't think any other engine let you do something like that as far as I'm aware then after that we started messing around with random Marketplace models and things quickly got out of hand you can really search up the weirdest crap you could probably search up like Thanos sand and something would probably come up some gen Alpha thing SCU toilet scoid toilet R Ohio it's real I hate it I hate it so much sans's undertale he's te- posing look at him oh look at him s under oh oh jeez that's a little too big no not him I want to click his head think his head really small but his that is pretty funny if you search a boss fight you just get the funniest crap Obama boss fight Obama boss fight yes I want to play Obama boss fight there actually is an official Obama boss fight game you want to go official official by who the government yes what no I'm joking OB I want to play the Obama boss fight you want to play Obama boss fight yeah all right bro I'm sending it oh yeah and then we got distracted and fought Obama for a while what is this I don't know what is this bro what is this thing can't K it anymore oh OB s oh that's not Obama that's just president stuff Obama boss cuz yes Obama Minecraft what is this I can't think it anymore why is the baby in the sky did you do that no what what what go back the oh my God that's a that's a that's a the baby Among Us you did that there's a big wall over there what the f is this go check it out oh no oh my god oh know it this is this is Roblox development oh Jee oh uh oh I'm sorry oh my god oh it's laggy oh what what did he there there's a thing that said there's a thing that said box so sus you should place it and then I click on it I think it's a torrent what I think it's a the should I should I allow the scripts no should I click okay please no 20,000 no now this might it seem like I was just messing around and I was but for a good reason you see I have this one special trick that I use to help me learn anything I call it making it funny by simply making something that makes you laugh learning becomes a lot more fun you're also a lot more likely to remember something if you have a funny memory attached to it for example if you're learning how to apply textures why use a boring test texture when you can instead put a dumb meme instead or when debugging why print hello world or test when you could instead print something funny no one's going to stop you you're going to see a lot more examples of what I mean throughout the video I don't know if that sounds silly but it's the small things like that that makes gamedev so much fun for me in any case I didn't just mess around on my first day I also learned Lua the coding language Roblox uses to make scripts since I already know a couple of languages this was really easy and all I needed to learn was how Lua was written compared to the other ones that I knew and if you're struggling to learn a coding language especially your first one let me share with you the trick I use every time I learn a new language I simply make a text file and then I put examples of every new thing I learn so like an example of creating a variable or an IFL statement or a loop or the print function anything really by doing that I don't have to remember absolutely everything by heart I can simply copy and paste the examples whenever I need them instead of manually typing out the whole thing every single time and after a while your brain will start to automatically remember stuff and you won't need to look it up anymore this isn't Lazy by the way Pro pramming is all about saving time and copy pasting millions of players are doing the stupidest on Roblox God I hate the French whose idea was it to recreate this Neo Gothic nightmare day two this day was by far the steepest part of the learning curve I started off by putting aside the whole mess we did yesterday and instead created a new empty project going into it I already knew exactly what I wanted to code first a block that moves listen when I say you should start small when learning Game Dev I mean it so I found a tutorial and after a bit of confusion I got it to work and then I used a few for Loops to make it move in a square pattern now that's cool and all but it doesn't move the player when you stand on it which I expected was going to happen because it's technically not really moving it's just a static object teleporting slightly on every frame so I thought oh I know I'll try to manually code that in just check if the player is touching the platform and if so change the position like I knew that probably wasn't the best way to do it but I at least wanted to try skip ahead an hour later and nothing works I have no idea what I'm doing wow it's almost as as if trying to forcefully learn something that you don't even know if you should learn isn't a good idea so instead of racking my brain to figure out why something I don't understand doesn't work I moved on to something else I tried to learn user inputs as a test I thought I'd make it so that a brick would move when you press a certain key sounds easy enough so I put a script inside the part and follow the tutorial but it doesn't work turns out this user input service thing only works inside of a local script all right then so I create a local script and put the code in there and it still doesn't work oh turns out local scripts only work inside local objects and local objects are only for the player and not the physical 3D space oh okay then how am I suppose to code interactions between the player and the game world is what I was thinking at the time the problem is that I was still trying to code with a single player mentality but Roblox is a multiplayer game it doesn't work like that so I came to realize that I had to throw out all of my preconceptions and start to learn how to think with multiplayer for starters I went and learned how to properly read player inputs but then I discovered the instance function which lets you create new objects from a script so for fun I tried to use it from a keypress and to my surprise it actually works even though it's a local script so shouldn't it not be able to create server objects well whatever point is it works then for some reason I had the idea of making a ball spawner that would shoot out spheres everywhere after a bit of tinkering I got it to work but for some reason when it spawns it waits in the air a little bit before moving in the tutorial I watched it did the same thing so I don't think it's something I did wrong but it still really annoyed me so to fix that I simply made them invisible by default then made it so it would reappear a few frames after spawning it does not fix the original problem at all but hey it works and finally to finish off the day I learned how to add UI elements and things went smoothly for once I figured out all of the basics from a mix of messing around on my own and reading the documentation oh yeah and then I made a button that kills the player when you click on it and then I made it spawn an explosion too for good measures going into day three I knew exactly what I was going to do I was going to have my revenge on the moving platform and I would make it work the right way this time so I simply follow the tutorial and at long last I got it to work okay that's not supposed to happen uh oh I just forgot one line oops all right so now moving platforms work but while I was trying to fix the issue I found out about tweening which allows you to smoothly move apart from point A to point B which sounds simple enough but was a whole another issue to figure out getting one of them to work was easy enough but in order to keep the square pattern I had to chain several tween in a row and I could just not for the life of me figure out how for a while the first one would work fine then the second one would play twice and then it would stop moving and when I did eventually get them to play one after the other it started moving in a diamond pattern instead of a square pattern but I quickly realized that was because I misunderstood how the end points worked anyway once I did that there was something else I wanted to try so earlier I did say that I wouldn't try to make the game idea I had but surely trying to code just one of the game mechanics wouldn't hurt right I'm not going to reveal what the game is but what I can say is that I need to be able to change the color of the player's body parts I was easily able to make it work on a dummy character but for some reason I could just not get it to work on the actual player character I did find a tutorial that led me change a body part's color when colliding with another object but even with that knowledge I still couldn't manually change the color whenever I wanted now I did eventually figure out the problem at the end of day seven so in the meantime I tried to learn something else I wanted to make a projectile that the player could shoot with a mouse click but right away I faced the same problem I did on day two when I tried to learn player IM inputs except that this time around I had a lead to go off of a little something called remote events so I carefully read through the documentation attentively followed the tutorial and before long I did it I now finally knew how to link together client side and server side code with that knowledge in hand I felt like nothing could hold me back anymore now all I had left to do is make it so that the projectile moves in the same direction the camera is pointing at and since I was feeling so confident I wanted to try coding the math by myself using the power of sin and cost to transform camera angle values into speed values for all three axes fast forward 3 hours and I got kind of close I could get it to work in two Dimensions perfectly fine but as soon as I put all three the angles would become slightly off now by then it was like 3:00 a.m. so I decided to give up and look for the solution and as it turns out I could have just done this yep that's it a single line of code that's all I needed to do in a sentry on day four Ekko wanted to show me how to do basic 3D modeling on Roblox like by using blocks of negative space and fusing them to other shapes you can make holes and by fusing simple shapes together you can make some simple models so then we made a basic little campfire model and added a few particle effects and then we started adding a bunch of random models and got sidetracked again but I'll spare you the details this time anyway after that I wanted to try making a character model so I grabbed a few random shapes and made a totally random stick figure thing then I gave it a rigging skeleton and used it to make a very simple cartwheel animation and then I didn't touch the animation feature ever again but hey that's good to know I guess afterwards I wanted to learn how to display VAR balls on the HUD which led me to learn how to use the leaderboard so then I needed a way to test it so I looked around the project looked at my ball spawner and thought yeah sure they'll do and made it so that the money value goes up every time you touch a ball but then I got hit by a flash of inspiration in a sudden stroke of Genius I got a game idea so I immediately got to work and quickly built a simple prototype and over the rest of the day I would try to polish the game as much as possible I started by trying to add a texture to the Spheres and I decided to go with the good old Roblox man face I originally wanted the texture to wrap around the whole thing but for some reason Roblox treats spheres like cubes and gives it six faces that you can apply a texture to so I settled on using six separate decals to cover the whole thing then I wanted to make the Spheres Fade Out and despawn after a while but for some reason I couldn't change their opacity anymore and it took me way too long to realize that the Spheres did in fact become transparent but not the decals so I had to also change the decals opacity all six of them then I added two new types of balls a green one that gives you 10 points and a red one that kills you and with that I finally had something that started to look like a game now I also wanted to have a high score value that would get saved when you quit the game and come back and in order to do that you need to use what Roblox calls data stores but it looked kind of complicated and it was getting late so I decided to stop here for the day stop posting about follow I'm tired of seeing it my friends on Tik Tok send me on Discord it's so for day five I picked up right where I left off and started learning data stores and as it turns out it wasn't actually that complicated I got it working in like half an hour so then came the real test posting it to Roblox and trying it out for real so I made an announcement on my Discord server and got a few people to join and sure enough when they left and came back their high scores were saved well that was easy I sure do hope data stores don't end up causing a ton of bugs later down the line anyway now that I finally had a game Prototype I wanted to polish it as much as I could before my 7even days were up I started by giving the arena a little makeover now the camera can pass through the wall and they're only visible from the inside then I put it in the air and added a floor all right let's test it do not forget to Anchor floating objects oh right yeah yeah okay yeah there you go oh and also I lowered the floor a bit so now the Spheres can fall off the map I thought it made the game more interesting all right now this whole game idea started because I wanted to show a variable on the UI so let's actually do that and there you have it another thing I can put off my checklist let's see what else do I have in here here oh particle effects let's do that okay so real talk the Roblox particle system is really good like okay seriously look at this when you make a particle object you can modify things like color size transparency texture speed direction frequency how long it lives and more but then for some attributes you can open a graph to customize the value for any point during its life span and the changes apply in real time as you modify the graph and while I was writing this script I realized that you could even put a range of Randomness for any given point on the graph like yo that's so cool it gives you a lot of control while still being very easy to use okay uh I got a little carried away there but point is I added some particle effects when you touch a sphere awesome and finally I also put a glowing orb in the spot where the Spheres Spawn from and yeah that's about it for day five hey guys today we're going to be doing a Roblox game play oh okay day six let's speed things up the first thing I did was adding a little popup above your head when you grab a sphere and to achieve that I decided to use something called billboard GUI which basically allows you to have a UI element somewhere in 3D space about an hour later I got it working you know no big deal I was starting to get used to Roblox Studio following that I decided to split the money value into two things a score value that tracks how many points you have in the current game and a money value that tracks how many points you have in total because of that I had to rework most of the leaderboard and UI code which wasn't too bad but that was just the beginning making this change also meant that I now had two variables per player to save in the data store and that caused a lot of problems but I'll skip all the boring details what matters is that I did get it to work after a few hours and by that I mean that it was now midnight I felt bad for not adding that much new stuff for the day so I thought I'd try learning one last thing sound effects and uh yep it sure works one thing to note though is that you can only upload 10 sound effects a month which kind of sucks you do have unlimited access to the marketplace but put me down I can't take this please put me down what yeah it's a mixed bag anyhow before stopping for the day I finally gave the game some much needed sound effects have a listen all right the final day I will was starting to feel the strain of working on something 6 days in a row without taking a day off but hey if I want to be a game developer I'd better get used to it am I right anyway I wanted to spend the day adding as many features and as much polish as possible but after doing a quick multiplayer test I realized that data stores were still completely broken Bren and would cause various interesting bugs like having someone else's car show up on my UI somehow and then other bugs were just silly mistakes like here in the code that runs when you die your high score gets saved to the data store and if your score is higher than your high score your high score gets updated Can you spot the problem here well let's say you got a new high score and then died your current high score gets saved to the data store and then since your score is higher than your high score your high score gets updated so at that point if you were to quit the game and come back your high score would be lost you might have a mental image of a computer bug as being a small little math error that causes big problems but more often than not it's really just dumb things like this anyway after a long time of fixing similar bugs I finally got everything working correctly for real this time all I had to do was remove the part that wasn't working instead of fixing it okay now that everything worked I could finally start adding content and oh my God it's already 1: p.m. now with the limited time I had left I wanted to focus on diversifying the game play cuz as it is now every life is basically the same so my idea was to give the floor platform some random events using our good old friend tweening I can give the platform custom movements such as closing opening opening a lot tilting tilting but closed spinning moving side to side and my personal favorite bouncing I still had many ideas left like making a y element warn you about the upcoming event but unfortunately my time was up there's still quite a few things I wish I had learned but overall I think I'm happy with what I managed to make in only 7 Days oh and if you want to try the game out yourself I'll put a link to it in the description well before I knew it the Roblox learning week was over so what did I think of Roblox Studio well I liked it I thought it was really fun to use there were a few bumps along the road of course but overall Studio was really easy to learn now sure I already knew how to code and I have some Game Dev experience but Roblox Studio was the first time I ever successfully used an engine that's 3D multiplayer and only uses code cuz as a matter of fact most of my Game Dev experience actually comes from codeless engines now do I think Studio should be your first engine uh no I'd still recommend scratch but here's the thing in general most engines will have a trade-off between how easy it is to learn and how much power and freedom it gives you and I felt like Roblox gave you a pretty nice balance you're limited by the fact that you can only make games for Roblox but in exchange you're given a tool to easily make multiplayer games and by the way making a multiplayer game is really hard it's not as simple as clicking the make multiplayer button in your engine and on top of that hosting Game servers costs a lot of money yet the fact that Roblox will just give any anyone free server space at no costs that's really cool you shouldn't take that for granted okay so back to this graph real quick if your goal is to make a big 3D game but all you know is like scratch then I think Learning Studio could be a great way to ease the transition into bigger engines engines like oh I don't know Gau for example which incident the way gdau works with its node system is kind of similar to how Studio works with the whole parents child system I'm just saying lastly I'd like to quickly go over why I think Studio was so easy to learn mainly I'd say it's thanks to the official documentation This is How I Learned almost everything more than any tutorial and especially more than the AI assistant this is where I learned it all as long as you can like you know read and pay attention pay attention you can learn everything you'll ever need to know about Studio it's as easy as going on Google and typing Roblox than whatever you're trying to learn and usually it's the first link don't know how to use a search engine no problem just rightclick on any object and click help and heck in the code editor it'll constantly give you a short description of whatever you're typing and if you click the learn more button it'll send you straight to the documentation so you have no excuses Roblox is easy to learn and yeah I think Roblox studio is pretty fun however that's not quite the end of the story I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't also talk about Roblox itself so I quickly mentioned around the start of the video that Roblox has a lot of issues but there's one in particular that really bothers me here's the thing with Roblox for those who don't know Roblox has a premium currency called Roo that you can buy with real money and spend on in-game items and then as a developer you can add in-game purchases to your project and get a cut of the roox and if you're really successful you can become a Roblox partner and trade your roblo for real money and some people have gone actual millions of dollars doing that so chances are if you want to make a Roblox game it's because you just want to make some easy Roo but but here's my problem with that how do you think these developers made so much money by making really good highquality games and using honest business practices yeah right come on who am I kidding most likely it's by using the same kind of 30 tactics mobile games use to maximize profits like daily login bonuses limited time sale pay to win mechanics battle passes microtransactions loot boxes and of course gambling dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it ah yes selling gambling to Children a classic oh but it's not it's not real money it's fake in-game currency see it's not gambling yes ingame currency that you can buy with roblo which you can buy using real money I really think it's a shame that this is what Roblox is teaching to Young aspiring game developers to be greedy instead of wanting to make a fun experience and from what I've heard the Roblox algorithm seems to push games that make a lot of money which in turn makes the game more popular and thus makes more money regardless of if the game is actually good or not so if you want your game to be popular you don't have much of a choice or do you you know it doesn't have to be this way I don't think so instead of complaining that Roblox isn't what it used to be why don't we do something about it after all Roblox games aren't made by big companies they are made by people like you and me and what I hope that I've managed to show with this video is that making Roblox games is easy if I could learn to do that in a week imagine what you could do in like a month or two you know you could even have a couple of friends tag along thanks to the team create feature and when you play Roblox and you finally find a good game tell people about it share it to your friends support the Creator if you can you can also watch share and make videos about underrated Roblox games and if you know anyone that wastes their Precious roox on brain rot games try to convince them to maybe stop if we all do our part then maybe just maybe we can make Roblox a slightly better place and you know what if you you want to put a little donation option in your game that's fine if you can make a few roblo like that good for you that's awesome just don't do it just for the robo do it cuz it's fun all right but hey at the end of the day only one thing is for sure in life there's Roblox

S9Mpa_0wTrM	Beginners Roblox Lua Scripting Tutorial - Crash Course	Omnidev	1360518	19:20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9Mpa_0wTrM	roblox lua tutorial beginner	hey guys we're devs here we're gonna learn how to script with Lua 4 roblox games this is just a beginner tutorial so we'll only be learning some of the fundamentals I will also be throwing in a few events subjects but only in an introductory manner so you guys don't get too lost to be honest I haven't been active on roblox the past 4 years so I am a bit rusty I had to do lots of refreshing to get back up to speed so if you guys who leave a like I would greatly appreciate that to start off or what I need to launch a roblox game and to do that obviously you're getting to go to roblox calm one-shot robust calm you just see towards the top a button that says create so if we click on that it'll navigate us to slash develop which basically looks like this you won't have 0 games but if this is your first time to do anything maybe a couple of games but just for this tutorial I'll be creating a new game so click on that button and I'll choose baseplate just to keep things clean then click create game they should see a new game towards the top I'll click on edit and then they should launch for a block studio if you don't have roblox studio installed it'll probably start downloading in the bottom left here you would just click on that installer and then it will pretty much run this right here and once you're inside of your game it should look something like this if you're not already familiar with roblox to do you just use this to actually create your game I like to have my roblox 2d look a specific way so I'm going to be changing out the windows I'll just get rid of this here I want to keep output I'm going to get rid of the terrain editor I'm gonna move properties more towards the left and this is how I like it Explorer output properties and if you can't find these windows you can always just go to view and then you'll find them up here so I'll put output you know he's just hide it like that same for properties and same for the Explorer more on these windows a little bit later before we continue you'll need to know a few things first you need to know datatypes all you really need to know about is a boolean number and a string these are really basic the most common you'll be learning these in another tutorial but for now just numbers string and boolean nice create a script and set of server script service and to do that we'll need to dive again to Explorer right click on server script service insert object and script will just get rid of that here the string data type is a text value you know code is a string when you see characters wrapped and set of rotations so something like subscribe to wrd and side these quotes as a string the number data type was literally just numbers so if you put those numbers and set up a quotation and I become the string which you can tell from the syntax colouring numbers are blue and strings are purple but just know that numbers do not have quotes around it because again if it has quotes around it is a string remember that the boolean data type is just a true or false value true means exactly as it doesn't plain English true means yes and false means no again writing them in quotations will actually turn into a string so you can't ever just write true instead of invitations and expect it to act as a boolean this will be parsed as a string in certain conditions as technically can be used as a boolean so those are the three data types really know about they're pretty simple now let's use those data types inside of actual coding I'll be writing something in the console or in lua terms print so type in print parentheses quotations hello world notice that we put a string inside of these parentheses so now what it's going to do is output this string or text into this console here the output navigating through the script menu tab we would look for this play button with the roblox character over click on this drop-down menu button and then click on run and this will just run all the scripts inside of the game and notice inside of the output it says hello world so technically you just wrote your first script congratulations this is actually a big step albeit a simple task this is where lots of great developers start and learning a new language the longtime tradition of printing hello world I know that this is extremely boring and seemingly huse 'less but we will do a lot more very soon like moving a brick patience please now stop printing the number data type so again I'll just type in print parentheses and I'll just put in 99 and you know you feel like you make it longer if you want because we clicked on this Run button here you now see a play button so you can click on that and then you'll see that it prints this exact number into the output of course we can get the exact same output by putting it in quotations but by definition that this is now a string not a number data type in most situations this will be treated the same way as numbers what the number data type you can do or arithmetic so print 5 plus 5 and then you get 10 because 5 plus 5 is 10 and oddly enough you can do 5 plus the string of and then it'll still print out 10 which is really weird because in other languages this doesn't work out but whatever there's something to keep in mind and now let's try printing out the boolean data type so printed true let's also do another line of print false and run you'll see it prints out true and prints out false and of course you can't get the exact same output by just wrapping inside of quotations but again it's not actually going to be a boolean value because now by definition is a string because it's inside of quotations you know just to show you true and false again and output so that was a really simple quick start as you saw we inserted a script into a server script service and we typed in code and then the game executed once we clicked on run and I'm not sure if you noticed but roblox actually has a syntax highlighter so when you make a string you know it's a string because it's purple when you have a boolean you know it's a boolean because it's like this dark blue color and when you have a number you know it's a number because it has this light blue color you can't actually change the syntax highlighting colors but by default these are the colors you would see so now let's move on to comments comments aren't actually code they're quite literally just notes for the code or to read it is completely ignored by the Lua executor and when you have hundreds of lines of code it's gonna be difficult to kind of read through everything again especially if you haven't looked at your code after weeks so leaving comments can be great refresher being a new learner of roebucks Lua you'll definitely want to frequently write comments sort of write a comments you would start off with a double dash and then you would write your note right after it which might be this is a YouTube tutorial and then that will be ignored by the Lua executor but like I said comments are ignored by the Lua executor so if I were to type in print then the string of HelloWorld it's not going to print into the output because again comments are ignored so let's run and show you there's nothing in the output but it's not like there's a Sables the entire script because if I were to type in print of blah blah it'll still print it to the output you see blah blah because this isn't commented out but if I were to comment it out no it doesn't run so it's really useful to just leave notes above your code so as you should have noticed the double dash only works for one line so this is called a single line comment it doesn't actually comment this out because as you saw it still executes but if you wanted to comment out multiple lines you would use something called a multi-line comment and to write that you would type in double dash two opening brackets two closing brackets and then two double dashes and then between that you would type in your comment so this is a comment a put code in between that it should show you that it is an actual comment this shouldn't print and then under our comment but this will print so we're gonna expect this to not print but we'll expect this one a print as you see that works we're almost done here one more thing with the boring stuff so let's move on to variables a variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our code can manipulate it can hold different types of variables so a variable can hold a boolean a variable can hold a string and a variable can hold a number so if you were to pick the variable name of my var my variable and then say equals one two three my var is now this exact same thing as 1 2 3 so now if I were to print my var notice it's case sensitive so you would have to type it exactly as you named it capital v capital v here and run you'll see that it outputted one two three your names can be almost anything so like I can let me just do this that's complete nonsense it's not reserved anywhere and then just paste that inside of print it'll print out one two three there are a few names that you can't use for example print because print is already used by Lua so you got to pick something else another thing to note is that you can't start your variable name with a number so this will not work it's going to error and you know it's a problem because it has this red underlining here but you can't end your variable name with a number and I'm to show you that variables can work with other data type so I'll create a string and say please like this video hint hint will print that out and then you should see please like this video in the output you can even do arithmetic inside of your variable so one plus one you should expect it to print out two because one plus one is two as you can see two we can even use the boolean data type we learned so my bar true and then it should print out true because my bar is equal to true so that's all the boring stuff out of the way so now let's try actually manipulating the game I'm going to right click in the game here and insert part and now you just got this brick in your 3d space so now if we click on the brick and then look inside of your properties window which if you copied me I move my properties window to the left you'll see a bunch of properties listed down here to the left is the property name and to the right is the property value if I wanted to change brick color inside of the game I can just click on the brick and then choose a different color here so if I choose red its gonna be red and then you see its name is really red if I choose black then it's color is black instead of changing the color manually let's try doing this with the script navigating back to our script that we created I'm going to say game dot workspace dot part so this works the same way as the file tree would like how you would navigate through your folders inside of windows so game is basically your game Explorer and then from game we would go into workspace and then from game we would go into part and by clicking part you see that it is highlighting this it's selecting the part inside of workspace and workspaces inside of game now let's select the brick color property so dot brick color this is case sensitive so when you're going to select part you're going to want to select the exact name notice has a capital P so I put in a capital P brick color has a capital B and C so I put in a capital B and C and just like you would with a variable you can set the value by using the equal sign and then we'll put in brick color dots new parentheses then we'll put in the string data type being whatever new color you want so if I'm writing Lee changed this to white so now you know it's white and then say if the string value will be black and then we run this script you'll see that I changed the black now let me just show you a quick little something if we put in weight and then parentheses you should pass in a number here and it will say 3 the numbers out of the parentheses of weight is just the amount of seconds I should pass before it moves on to the next line so we're going to wait three seconds before it changes the color to black and then we'll add another weight down here let's say three seconds again we'll navigate down the Falla tree again to game dot workspace dot part dot brick color equals brick color dot new parentheses and then your string whatever new color you want so eggplant we just type in that brick color name and then it should change it eggplant after three seconds so again some when we click on run the script is going to wait three seconds and then it will change the color to black it'll wait three seconds again and then it will change the color to eggplant which is purple basically so I'm navigating back into this game View tab you can go over to the test tab and then click on the Run button wait three seconds it's black wait three seconds again it's now eggplant and looking at the property you see it says eggplant so you pretty much is it a lot in this grip you use the number data type to make the script wait three seconds before moving on to the next line and then use the string that are typed to pass a new value for brick color so now I'm gonna create a problem to should show you how Lua works a little bit I'll copy this brick I'll repay sit back in the workspace and now looking at this code here you're gonna see who's gonna try navigating into game dot workspace dot part so the game Explorer workspace dot part and the change sub brick color to black let's see what happens you see that I only changed one if you wanted to change both obviously that's a problem so to solve this we would just select one of the parts that has a duplicated name right click it click on rename and we'll just say you Britt - it could be any name of course now if we navigate to game dot workspace dot - brick - again case-sensitive and then set brick color equal to brick color dots new plum now if we run you now see that both of these brick colors were changed and of course if you wanted to change it to black then go ahead I'll change they'll both change to black let's make this file tree navigation slightly more complicated so I'll be grabbing brick - and then drag it inside a part we just made brick - a child of part so to navigate down to it we're gonna have to do game dot workspace doctor part brick - and now you can do brick color equals the color dots new black as you can see that worked but if you were to just do game that works paste of brick to die brick color this doesn't work because brick 2 is not a valid member of workspace as you don't see brick to you inside of here it's inside of part and that just means there's no direct child of workspace that is named brick - you have to go workspace dot part dot brick - like you saw inside of the script here so now I'll just delete brick to make things slightly more simple and let's try changing another property let's say we wanted to change the position obviously buddy needs to navigate to the part so gain that workspace top part dot position equals vector three dot new and the vector three value is basically the position inside of a 3d graph so let's set the x value to five the Y value to ten and the Z value to 15 you would have to delimit these by using a comma and by running the script you're gonna see that the part is moved they went all the way here and clicking on the part so selecting the part and then looking at the position property right clicking on this drop down button here you see the X is 5 y is 10 and the Z is 15 of course you can manually change that here to figure out what direction is up should have made that anchored well now you know that to change the position you have to do vector 3 and then enter the XYZ position values which are numbers now let's try solving that problem how that brick kind of just fell so I'm gonna go over to this model tab select move and I'll just drag this up a bit I'll just get rid of this code to get rid of any interference and if you go back to test and run the brick should fall because we do not set the anchor value but if you click on the anchor check box this basically sets anchored to the value of true it should stay in the air we just anchored its position it's gonna stay exactly where it is but once you disable anchored it false now that changed us how your script you would obviously navigate to you part again so game that workspace tough part dots anchored equals true it's the same with that manually so now it's gonna set it to true we will expect this brick to not fall in tree hit run and great it doesn't fall now let's set this manually to true so if we hit run obviously it doesn't fall but to make it fall using the script will say anchored equals false and then you see it does fall because it is no longer anchored thanks to you sending the incurred property to false you'd pretty much change all the other properties the same way using the three data types I showed you in the beginning of this video string number and boolean 's except for the few special things like we saw with color we had to use color three new let's try changing the material if you click on this drop-down button and select grass you see it gives it this different texture to change that usually Lua script you would obviously navigate to your part game that works we stopped heart select the material property and then we'd set that equal to a string values as you can see it's a string to check out the options you can choose again you would just look at this drop-down menu here and let's say I want to use foil I'll put foil inside of this string and then run and now and now you see just change to the foil material if we get rid of the quotations it's no longer a string and it's pretty much expecting a variable or a global but that's more advanced I'll teach you what Global's are in another tutorial oil isn't defined anywhere so this will error and now you see it's not changed the foil so now you know that you have to use quotations if you're gonna try to set a string value I just showed you that a while ago but let's try setting a value using a variable so let's choose a variable name I'll save Matt bar material variable set it equal to boil let's copy that variable name and then put it right here and that we should set the parts material to foil you could have done that with positions too so I'll just name the variable to my bar equals vector 3.2 new let's say 5 5 5 say game that works because top part dot to position equals my var so now we no longer have to do equals vector 3 new because you can just use the variable which already has this value here so we'll hit run and then you should see that the position will change to 5 5 5 as you saw position 5 by 5 so you'd pretty much change all the other properties the same way if you wanted to change cast shadow you see it's a check box so you would say gander workspace top part that cast shadow equals false you should already know how to change color the change material obviously you see it's a string so you would set the value equal to a string being whatever options you can choose reflectance would be a number value so you would say again that workspace top part the reflectance equals 0.5 we don't see it because the material is weird to see the reflectance you're going to want to set it back to plastic and now you should see that the reflectance is changing so back to 0 no reflection back to 1 then you see that the cloud is lefting onto the brick same thing for transparency he would say again that works based on part that transparency equals a number of value 1 being completely invisible and zero being completely opaque you can see it point 5 being half invisible so set this back to fully opaque and let's try changing the transparency with the script game dot workspace part transparency equals a number value and again it's from 0 to 1 so 0.5 to make it half invisible hit run and now you see it's f invisible at the change the name you would pass in a string because as you can see that's what it is it's a string orientation you see it's got these three values with the two commas you know it's a vector 3 position so and that works based apart the orientation equals vector 3 that new and then your 3 vector values position vector 3 but rotation velocity vector 3 velocity vector 3 and your boolean's here number blah blah blah it's pretty obvious so I pretty much just taught you more than enough to get going with basic Lua scripting you know what I consider to be the three basic data types string number boolean you know how to navigate the game's file tree using the script and then changing a bricks properties you know how to use the console and you know and you know how to use comments to leave notes under your code you learned a lot and that concludes this beginners robot to a crash course there are so much more to learn but that's all I'm going to be teaching in this beginners tutorial if

ei2Pc4xV1cQ	Printing - Roblox Beginners Scripting Tutorial #2 (2025)	BrawlDev	898495	9:59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei2Pc4xV1cQ	roblox scripting tutorial	Welcome back to my Roblox beginner scripting tutorial guide. My name is Balddev and in this episode we'll be discussing about printing. So in the last episode we covered the basics of navigating around Roblox Studio and what Roblox Studio has to offer for us that's going to be important for this entire tutorial guide. So for things like moving around inside of Roblox Studio, also showing you the services that Roblox has to offer for us, the explorer panel, and also the properties panel that we're going to be using throughout this entire tutorial guide. Now that we have that understanding, uh, for the rest of this tutorial guide, I'm going to be introducing to you concepts relating to scripting. Now, to basically explain what scripting is, it's an aspect of game development that allows you to add functionality to your games that you're creating on Roblox. So, the other aspects of game development are things like building, like we just did right here. Um, maybe even things like modeling and also, um, UI designing and all of these other sorts of things. Scripting is a component of game development that allows you to add functionality to your game. An example I can think of this is this spawn location right here. So making the spawn location itself requires building. But actually making it functional requires scripting. So if my character were to join into the game, then we need to tell Roblox that we need to spawn on this spawn location. And if our character dies, then we need to respawn back onto this spawn location. that is what adds functionality to the spawn location rather than it just being some random part inside of the game. So that requires scripting to be able to um essentially tell Roblox that we want this uh spawn location to function the way it is because of it. And we add functionality through scripts. Now, to explain what a script is, it's basically a document or a piece of paper that has a list of instructions or commands that basically tells Roblox to execute these commands when we join into the game or when a specific thing happens inside of the game. And so, when we write these scripts, it's very important for us to write it in a very specific way so that Roblox can read these commands and they can interpret it so they can understand it, finally execute them inside of our game. Because this is one of the biggest things new developers get confused with and that is being able to uh get the syntax down like understanding the rules and guidelines when it comes to um writing these commands because they fall under a programming language called Lua or Lua uh for Roblox. And so when we understand this language then we're able to write commands effectively and tell Roblox to execute certain commands within our scripts. So, let's actually create our first script. And we're going to be adding this inside of the explorer. And there's two places that are popular for scripts. The first one is the workspace, and the second one is the server script service. But for this episode, we're going to add a script inside of workspace. And there's there's a couple ways you can add objects inside of a folder. One way is to hit this plus sign that's next to workspace. So, I'm going to click on this, and there should be a list full of all of these um objects that we can put inside of this folder. So, what I'm going to do is say script inside of the search bar. And there's three scripts, but for the sake of this tutorial, we're just going to be using the normal script. So, I'm just going to click on this. And now we have inserted a script inside of our workspace. And you might have also noticed that our screen has changed to be inside of this script editor. And we can revert back to the game if we want to by hitting down this tab right here. So, we are now back into the normal game. And if we want to go back into the script, then we just simply click on the script so that we can pull up the script editor again. And when we open up the script for the first time, Roblox is going to add a default um command here that simply just says print hello world. Now, it might be a little hard to read for you. So, what I want you to do is hit control and then move the mouse scroll wheel inward so that you can zoom in. Um, but I'm already zoomed in pretty well, so if you need to do that, then you can do that very quickly. So for this first scripting episode, what I'm going to show you how to do is write these print statements. Now what is a print statement? A print statement is basically a command that allows us to write a message to an output window so that we can see it uh when we run the game. Now, in order to know where this output window is, what we need to do is go back into the game, hit on the view tab, and we're going to click on this button that says output. So if we click on this then we can see this window down here that shows our um our print statements and also our logs as well. That's the whole point of the output window. It's so that we can see whatever we put inside of here show up down here when we join into the game. So if we go into the game, we can actually test this out for ourselves. The way we do that is by hitting on this test tab up here and then we click on this button that says play. So if we click on this then what's going to happen is first of all our our character actually loads into the game and we can play this game normally as if this was a Roblox game. Um but also down here we can see in the output it says hello world which was our message and we can actually click on um the script that executed this command and it's going to show us the script and also the line of where our print message executed. So this print statement is basically a print command that tells Roblox that we want to print this message down here inside of this output so that we can see it for ourselves. And we can write our own print statements as well um rather than having Roblox's default print message right over here. So what we can do is actually delete this print statement so that we can write our own print statement. So what I'm going to do is hold down the backspace so that it basically deletes all the lines of code that um was over here. So we are on line number one and now let's add in our first print statement. Now one quick thing I want to mention is that when we are writing our scripts it's very case sensitive and what that means is you have to be very specific with how you write stuff inside of the script. So some things can be uppercase, some things can be lowercase. And it's very important that we understand when it is uppercase and when it's lowerase. So now let's write our print statement. We're simply going to say in all lowercase, we're going to say print p r i n t and then what we're going to do is type the open parenthesis. So we're going to press shift 9. And then we're also going to put in the double quotations. So we're going to say shift apostrophe. And so now we can write whatever message we want inside of these quotations. So we can say something as simple as hello just like this with an exclamation mark. And there we go. This is our very first print statement that we have going on right over here. We can test this by going into the game and hitting play. So as we can see in the output, it indeed printed our message with hello. Now, I forgot to mention really quickly that uh when we're playing the game inside of Roblox Studio, like we hit play, uh in order for us to stop play testing, uh we go up here and then just simply hit the stop button. I forgot to mention this because I do it out of instinct. So, I apologize about that. Um so, what we're going to do is hit stop. And now we are back into Roblox Studio. So, now let's go back to our script. And we can actually add more print statements on top of this print statement. So, what we're going to do is drop a line by hitting enter. And as you can see, we are now on line number two. So we can write our print statement just like uh we did the first time by saying print open parenthesis and we're going to say double quotations. And we can continue what we were saying before by saying how are you doing question mark just like this. So now we have two print statements. If we go into the game and hit play, then what we should see in the output is two of our print statements instead of just one. So, it's going to start with hello and then it's going to say how are you doing? So, if we hit stop and then we go into the script, we can continue this chain of print statements if we want to. Uh, we can go and hit enter and then we can write another print statement by saying print open parenthesis double quotations and then I can say I'm doing very well exclamation mark. So now we have three print statements and you can continue going down the script editor and just keep adding more and more print statements if you want to do that. Um because you can make this as long as you want to. Like there's like you have the power to make as many print statements as you want. Like if we go back into the game and hit play then as you can see in the output it's going to display the three print messages that we just created. Now you don't have to worry about the syntax for right now. That's going to be explained in a future episode. But what I want you to do is I literally want you to type exactly what I'm typing here so that you get the feel for knowing how to implement this stuff inside of Roblox Studio and so that you're getting the experience alongside me as we go through these scripting episodes. So that's basically going to be it for this episode. What I want you to do for today's learning objective is to continue this story of like you know these three print statements. You could just continue down here by writing another print statement or if you want you can delete all of these print statements and write your own story or whatever it is you want to create. So you can just delete the entire thing and then you can start back from square one if you want to. It's really up to you with what you want to do. Now, after you do this, what I encourage you to do is take your print statements, go down to the comment section of this video, and then paste it so that other viewers can see um your poem or your message or whatever it is that you're comfortable sharing uh to everybody else because I just think it would be very fun to see what everybody's doing for these challenges. So, go ahead and do that uh once you finish with this learning objective. And one more thing before we end off this video. If you get stuck at any point throughout this tutorial guide, I have a Discord server which you can go into to ask questions and get help for your scripts if you want through the link in the description. So, if you're interested, then feel free to join my Discord server to get help while you go through this tutorial guide. So, that's pretty much going to be it for this tutorial guide. I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next episode.

fivk8yp-VT4	How pro Roblox developers learnt to script	AlvinBlox	923825	10:03	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fivk8yp-VT4	roblox scripting tutorial	learning scripting on roblox can be difficult so i decided to ask some of the best roblox developers out there what they did when learning to script and whether they have any tips for upcoming developers as well as this i recently did a survey where i asked a hundred developers about how they learned to script and i'll show you the results later on in the video firstly we're gonna hear from both bomber he's a former roblox intern and he was on the winning team of the rdc game jam 2020 like most people i got started by analyzing and tinkering with free models in open source code once i had a little bit of knowledge i would just try making things i'd pick something i wanted to make and get started and i got stuck a lot and when i did i would google the specific error message mathematical question api or whatever and by doing so i wouldn't just be blindly following a tutorial on how to do this how to do that i was learning the guts and what made these programs tick and understanding it so that i would be able to use that knowledge in other applications and as time went on i got stuck less and less often until i crossed the line of knowing how to script something i want to pick up on which bomb i spoke about is that it's important to learn the code instead of just learning how to make something since learning the code and understanding what elements of code do will allow you to create things yourself and will make you able to visualize projects in your head lots of people struggle to plan scripts out because they don't fully understand the code basics and they don't know where or why elements of code should be used picking apart free models and open source code helps you understand why a developer has chosen to use code in their scripts because you get to see the decisions that they've made and this is a great way to learn if you're ever struggling to understand where you'd use some code always ask for help whether it's on the forums or just by asking a friend because you'll be able to see a practical example of where this code is used so thanks to both bummer for sharing his story you can check out his game lua learning on roblox is a great resource for learning to script i'll leave a link in the description next we're going to hear from wesley he created roblox deathrun which has nearly 300 million visits and has been on roadblocks since 2008 he's also been a roblox intern so over to you when i started out on roblox the first game that i wanted to make was a hide-and-seek game i had played a few that were popular at the time and i thought it would be quite fun to make my own twist with my own map and be able to build it myself but at the time i had no clue how to script it so the first step that i did is i went out looking for things that i could learn from so i went to the three models i found mini game scripts hide and seek scripts anything that i thought would be remotely similar to what i was looking for now with this it was not my intention to just take a script and use that as it was i actually wanted to learn from it and essentially piece together my own game script from all of these other scripts that i found so the first step was to actually start reading through every single script line by line word by word make sure that i understand every single thing that it did and my number one resource for that was the roblox wiki which nowadays is the developer hub and essentially just looking for the api reference for every single thing that i did not understand it was a very tedious process but while doing that i actually got quite a good hang of what every single bit of code did and i think later that week i was able to take the best pieces of code from each script i understood how to tie up all the variables together and in the next week i had a working height in c game it wasn't perfect but it worked now the reason why i wanted to tell you that story is because i still use this same approach today whenever i want to do something that i haven't yet done or i want to work with a new api or want to do anything that i haven't had experience with the first thing that i do is i'll look up a practical example of someone else who has done it to see how they implemented it to see the types of decisions that they made when working with that feature or mechanic and with that approach you get a lot more experience and you really start to understand a feature or mechanic or a new api a lot better than if you were to just read through the api documentation by looking at what someone else has done with a piece of code or a certain mechanic you already get a good idea of how this can be used in a game or in a script or wherever you want to apply it and if you're watching alvin's videos you're already applying this on a daily basis because you're seeing someone else work with the code you're seeing someone else work with the feature and then after you've seen it you go and try it yourself already having seen what it can do just really sets you up for success and really helps you to understand how this can benefit your own work in your own games and at that point if you come across a piece of code or a snippet that you don't know how to work with you at least have a better idea of what you want that snippet to do so when you go look it up on the developer hub or the api reference it's a lot easier to understand it because you have a much bigger sense of context so that's how i started 10 years ago and it's still the same approach that i use today and i hope it also helps you to get a much better understanding of your code as you're writing it even when you're working with things you haven't worked with before thanks wesley you can find wesley on twitter at wesley rblx i'll leave a link in the description did you notice that he said he started making roblox games for fun back then there was no devx the only incentive was to earn roe bucks to buy hats and items and so most developers were just creating games as a hobby my advice to you would be to treat roblox development as a hobby as you get started and make small projects which you find fun because learning scripting shouldn't be a chore it should be something you enjoy okay so earlier in the video i told you about a survey that i did of 100 roblox developers so i asked them what they did when learning to script and what the best resource they used was 65 of the developers used free models to pick apart code inside and 58 actively made small projects to help build on their knowledge many of the respondents mentioned how they used tutorials and the roblox wiki which is now called the dev hub to gain initial basic knowledge and once they had that knowledge they began to start making basic games and they'd go online to ask for help whenever they got stuck a good quote which i'd like to mention is that your first game may be awful but you can't make your 50th game without making your first so as bad as that first one might be you can always improve on what you didn't do well at in the future finally let's hear from am also known as mister a former roblox accelerator intern and developer of my droplets she also recently began posting roblox development videos on her youtube channel and i'll leave a link to that in the description if you want to check it out when you have an idea that you want to script try to break it down into the smallest bits and pieces as much as you can and look up how to do those individual things if you're trying to do something math related try to figure out what exactly you're trying to calculate look up if anybody else has already solved it that helps for one thing if you want to make a menu look up how to manipulate a button on roblox look up how to use user input service that kind of stuff just look up small bits and pieces of the whole idea that you have and try to figure out how to do those pieces whether it's taking code from other people and putting into your game and manipulating it or starting completely from scratch and just looking up each individual piece that you want to make sometimes it can be hard because searching for keywords can be difficult but usually even today i just look up the exact thing that i want if nothing is coming up for this specific idea that you want you want to break it down further and simplify it uh so that you can explain it better to the internet eventually you will find some bit of code that in the end you can manipulate and figure out how it works and script exactly what you want and in that sense you're going to learn a lot from that experience and grow as a programmer so it's really helpful to just look up any kind of small ideas that you have sometimes people have like like if you've heard of uh inktober there's things for scriptures too i think it's called a coder advent calendar um you can look up that kind of stuff if you're lacking in ideas and kind of try your best to try these challenges and make these things that people want you to make that can also be pretty fun so that's another way for you to get small projects but really the goal here is just to apply what you learn as much as you can through different small projects that you create that's how i personally was able to get really far as a programmer because i had ideas that i actually wanted to implement and i was passionate about them and so it was really motivating for me to actually like see my work coming to life and happening so yeah just try to apply everything you can as often as you can another great reason why you should create smaller projects as an said is so you can see the progress that you're making which will help you to stay motivated in the long term personally when i was a beginner scripter i tried to make huge games which even now would take me months to do since they're so complex and it would just totally knock my motivation as i soon realized it was too much for me to do back then a big thanks to boat

UoVYIZYKPOI	Advanced Roblox Scripting Tutorial #1 - Tools (Beginner to Pro 2019)	TheDevKing	682466	13:06	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoVYIZYKPOI	roblox scripting tutorial	all righty guys it is the Deaf king here back with another video and in today's video guys I'm gonna be showing you how to make tools so look at this look at that okay so this is my first tool well not really because I'm a told before but anyways this is what a tool is and basically it's like a little weapon you can equip and you can make it do stuff so yeah so I press one and you know I equip it that's what a tool is now you've probably seen them before in roblox games and they're pretty important I use them quite a bit and you probably will too so we need to know them you need to know how to use them so anyways guys let's get right in this tutorial and I'm gonna show you how to make tools and all about them okay guys so first things first before we get into the video I just want to say if this is your first video by me please go to the link in the description and watch the ones all before this there's a playlist there you might get confused and you probably will get confused if you don't know the basics so I'm yeah make sure to watch that and also guys welcome to your first episode of the advanced series okay you guys have graduated the double you know you graduated the advanced or the beginners series that's really awesome seriously guys it's like it's like it's something to be proud of case so package stuff on the back guys seriously you guys did a great job going all the way through that and hopefully you did but um yeah and if you do this video like I said or if he new to this video like I said please watch the beginner series first or else you're gonna be really confused cuz this is the advanced stuff so yeah anyway so let's go ahead and get into this tutorial and show you all about tools okay alright so I'm gonna go ahead and elite this but um also guys this video might be a little bit long because tools are pretty they're not hard but it's a lot goes into them so yeah okay guys so first things first I'm gonna go ahead and make my tool so in roblox you have these instances or instances called tools so if you go over here in the workspace you can go ahead and put right click it and then hit insert object and then you can find tool right and now basically I already showed you what it is but it basically you can equip and stuff like that but if it's in the workspace it actually won't go to your character so you're gonna need to move it to your starter pack now basically right here starter pack what starter pack does is anything that's inside of this folder starter pack is gonna go right into your character and you'll have it in your inventory and you'll be able to use it that's basically what it is so yeah alright so we're gonna go ahead and a Mar - we're gonna call it block sword okay so we're gonna make a block sword right so we're gonna go ahead and name it that and then we're going to go ahead and add a part into it okay so if you actually just have a tool the you know roblox just knows that's what you need to equip but it doesn't know what the tool supposed to look like right so you need to make a part now if it's in your starter pack you actually can't see the tool it's like in like the starter pack so you need to move it back into your workspace to see it so yeah now we can mess with the parts and stuff okay so um right now I only want to make one like one part out of the tool okay so don't enter any more parts into here also won't work that's a little bit more advanced we'll get into that later but for right now just use one part and we're going to make a little sword type thing now this is gonna look really bad okay um I'm gonna try to see if I can change the shape it's like a cylinder maybe okay that that doesn't look good but you know what this is gonna be our sword okay now listen this is a sword okay so I'm gonna make it like I'm not black okay we're gonna get the there you got that color okay paste all yellow okay this is our sword right now okay and now if we go ahead and move this back quarter pack we can start the game and actually actually before we do that don't start the game I forgot to mention one thing you need to make sure that your um your part inside of the work space right we're not sentient workplace your part inside of the tool is named handle because basically roblox needs to know what you like what part of the tool needs to be a handle and right now we only have one part so obviously it's the only part we have so make sure you guys reading them that handle and make sure has a capital H - roses will not work so yeah so basically it's kind of weird but it needs to be followed exactly like that handle just like that and then it'll work you know good so yeah make sure it's name panel with the part and yeah it should be good you can keep the tool name whatever you want but the handle or the part needs to be named panel or one of the parts need to be so anyways now that when you started that or now that we put that set that out put that in the starter pack so that way it'll go into our character so now let's go ahead and hit play show you some stuff about tools okay so let's go ahead and play and okay and boom we got our first tool and I'm holding it sideways okay you don't need to make your tool look like mine if you want to you can but yeah I okay anyway so this is what it looks like great I'm holding it out and I obviously I can rotate it I can do something like that to it but um yeah but yeah okay so one more thing about told you guys need to know when you have a tool right right now it was in the starter pack so that it went from the starter pack right two players to my player cuz you know that's the only person playing the game and then it went to my backpack okay cuz it's a starter pack and then it goes right in the backpack basically it's what starter pack does right so then right now it's in my backpack now if I were to equip the sword it disappears now you're probably wondering why doesn't why isn't on your backpack anymore basically when you have a tool equipped in roblox it actually gets ready it goes out of your backpack and it goes into your character now okay now let me clean one more quick thing so there's okay in roblox studio there's players and there's characters now players and characters are pretty much the same thing but the difference between the two is that a player is like this thing right here right it's like the little stuff it's a player you see the little icon there right and players that's what a player is okay it's named tapwater RB elect which is my username right but there's also a character in the characters in the workspace because you know everyone in the game needs to be able to see your character and I don't you know you want to see it too because if you move your character into the oh crap if you move your character into the I just okay if you recover into the players it wouldn't work and I don't think so yeah so that's what your character is it's the thing in the workspace and basically all like the parts of you like you see you have your foot you have your all that stuff that's what the character is so yeah I hope you guys get that cuz that's pretty important anyways that's what okay so yeah basically it goes from your backpack into your player as you can see here it's now a bunch the child of my player or I'm sorry it goes with my backpack into my character I'm so sorry and so now it's a child of my back or of my character okay geez hope here's going I'm saying you see it teleports back and forth okay as you can see there so yeah when having a clip when I don't have it recovered it's in my backpack anyways that's pretty important okay now second thing second I need to go ahead and show you guys yeah okay okay now I need to show you guys like how its make the tool do something you're probably wondering okay we made the tool now I want to make it actually like kill someone and maybe maybe not that but you know maybe want to make a kill like a make a block okay so we're gonna make a part here just to test it out and we're going to name this part we're going to call this parts destroy me okay and wait crap destroy me destroy me okay now what we want to do is we want our sword whenever it's equipped we want it to break this part whenever it touches it so yeah okay so what we're gonna do is insert a script into our tool so make a script and put it into your tool and then we're gonna go and cut all this out and also I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys a few the events of the for the tool which you need to know so I'm gonna go and open the object browser over here and scroll down to tool okay and here we go all right so um all these are pretty much the basic events that every object house these these six are here whatever but the ones I want to look at are activated deactivated and unequipped and equipped okay so they're pretty simple okay I'm gonna show you what they all do so we're gonna go ahead and well are we're gonna go ahead and assign the tool to a variable so we can have pretty easily so local tool equals script dot parent okay now we're gonna do tool not activated connects function now you should know what I'm doing right now because this is we learned this in the last or look we learn this in the beginners series so you should know how to do this and then we're gonna go ahead and make it prints you clicked me you click to me or okay okay basically what tool activated does right Toula activated it basically means whenever you click with the tool and like it's activated so whenever you click the tool and you have it equipped basically what it'll do is it'll run this event right here so it's gonna fire off activated and then test it out real quick to make sure it works and yeah hello click and boom see I can click anywhere but um and then it activates now what we want to do that as we want it whenever it activates we wanted to break this part is what we want to do so um yeah anyway so let me show you some more events for it first and then we'll do that in a second so we're gonna do tool dot deactivated now basically tool doc do you activated means if you like it runs right after you do back to it put the tool so like I'm pretty sure if you like hold it right so if you're oh wait crap and okay I put a thing in there but yeah if you hold like the the tool down when you haven't equipped basically it's gonna stay activated but then when you let go it's gonna deactivate so we're gonna go ahead and print I got deactivated okay and the tool sat now okay he's sad because you got deactivated okay anyways alright so let's see if this works oh wait I put our parenthesis in there that's that's gonna give me an error I think I don't know okay you know what I'm just gonna put it there we go he's happy now okay anyways okay um here we go let's click and then see it's activated right now I'm holding down my mouse button I'm holding it down and then let go I got deactivated and he's happy about that alright so cool it doesn't work okay so that's basically what those do those are pretty useful events and that's basically how you detect if it clicked and then we're gonna go ahead and show you tool dot equipped which is pretty simple guys it's basically if you cook the tool it runs so so I don't do that real quick so um let's go on prints yeah you are using me okay so basically now whenever I equip the tool it's going to be happy because I'm using him see and then if I click it's gonna activate and then if I let go it's gonna deactivate so there you go and unequipped basically is it's pretty simple it's basically when you you know on equipment it's what you know that's what the event does so it's gonna be the syntax fattest tool dot unequipped so I'm not gonna show you guys that one cuz it's pretty simple you know what that means but um yeah anyway so now let's go ahead and make it so it actually runs weird I and we actually want to do what the script says okay we're I'm sorry sorry we want to make it so whenever we activate the tool it breaks that part right here okay so destroying apart all right so we're gonna do now is write some code so we're going to do this okay we're gonna do tool to activate it so whenever it's activated we want it to destroy this thing so we're gonna go ahead and get the variable of that or sonet variable to that destroy anything right there so there's so the kind of the load the code doesn't get too long in one line so also let me zoom in hopefully that's kind of good so get our workspace not destroying me okay there we go and then we're gonna do destroy me destroy okay okay so basically basically what this destroy function does is it's a built-in function in roblox that just destroys the part and in the game aren't in the entire like memory okay so basically it's gonna delete so I'm yes now we're gonna just whenever we activate it's gonna destroy that part and let's make sure it works and oh there we go come on come on and there you go we don't have to look at or anything we can just destroy from anywhere but and boom it destroyed okay that's pretty awesome I like that okay so yeah that's what the activated thing does and that's some practical use for it and that's pretty much it guys I hope you did enjoy the video leave a like if you did enjoyed the video guys seriously and mate helps a lot so leave a like and subscribe if you're new what you shouldn't be new okay should be already subscribed okay what are you doing man but anyways that's time as it sort of guys we may have some more stuff explaining tool later on I'm not too sure but um but yeah anyways guys congratulations for completing your first tutorial of the BAM series I hope you understood this was a pretty fun thing to start off with so I wanted to do that but yeah in the advanced series we're gonna learn some like something about Mouse's or starting up Mouse's like using your mouse to click stuff like some other like oh like a remote function stuff like that and then we'll have a GUI series coming soon after the advanced series and once you know pretty much all the syntax and you know understand Lua pretty well so yeah enemies guys that's it and I'll see you in the next one peace out everyone	14208	t	This content addresses a fundamental Roblox development task by explaining how to create equippable

H4X8L5namhA	You CAN Script. Let me PROVE IT to you..	script_ing	599188	35:18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4X8L5namhA	roblox scripting tutorial	you can script even if you think you can't in this video I will prove it to you even if you've never touched Studio before if you don't know me my name is kushall I've been scripting since 2016 I've also been teaching it since the moment I began scripting in 2016 as you can see right over here with all of my 8 years ago tutorials in this video I'm going to start by teaching you some Basics and then after each lesson I'll give you a quiz to prove that you can do it even without me telling you step by step now as I teach you more and more stuff the quizzes will get harder and harder just know that I believe in you and as long as you watch the entire video and don't skip around you will understand it and everything will be okay every single time you get a quiz right you're going to get one point and there are five quizzes in this video and five points total let's see how many points you can get all right so I'm going to assume that you've never scripted before so just go to roblox.com slome this is the Roblox homepage which you're probably familiar with and then look for this create button right here and then from here you can click on create experience and then just wait for Roblox Studio to do its thing now if you see this auto recovery thing you can just X out of here and you can click on base plate all righty so this is the base plate right here this large gray thing right here is called the base plate and then this lighter gray thing with this spiral design is called the spawn location and these windows right here on the right are called Explorer and properties if you don't see them please click on view and look for the Explorer which should be right over here so make sure you can see that and then I'm click on properties so if you can't see them it might look like this so click on explore and properties and you should be able to see them and lastly just click on the spawn location and then right click it on the Explorer and click delete because we won't need it and it might mess us up all right so the Explorer basically tells you where everything is in your game and properties tells you more information about a specific thing so for example let's add a part I'm going to click on home and then click on part this right here is called a part it literally looks like a Lego block all right so if you click on your part then your properties will show a whole bunch of information about that part the first thing that I want you to notice is this thing called brick color if you click it you'll see there's a whole bunch of colors that we can set this part to one such color is Boom lime green another such color is Boom Cen Canan wait how do you even say that color C Canan okay Canan all right so now you can right click your part and you can delete it because we won't need it because we're scriptors now inside of server script service click on this plus sign right here this plus button right here and then click on script this right here is going to be your first script and look at what it says it says print hello world now what on Earth does that even mean right well if you click back on your place right here and you click on view click on this output right here this right here is the output and this is how scripts can communicate to us and what this print hello world thing does is it basically tells this output to put hello world right here and the way we're going to verify that this works is by clicking play right here this blue play button is how we test our game so I'm going to click this and as you can see it says hello world cool so that's pretty cool let's stop this right here now I have a question for you this isn't the first quiz just a question how would I make this Say Goodbye World okay think about it you can pause the video 3 2 1 okay so if you want this to Say Goodbye World you just have to change this hello to goodby bye and then click on this play button right here and there you go Goodbye World all right so hello world Goodbye World pretty easy right so let's actually make this say kushall says hello from YouTube what do you think this is going to do just pause the video and try to explain it to yourself if I were to click this play button what do you think this is going to do just pause the video and try to explain it 3 2 1 all right so if I click play as you can see it just prints Kusha say hello from YouTube so in other words whatever you put inside of this quotation mark right here inside of these quotation marks whatever you put in here will just go right over here all right so now that you guys got the hang of it let's actually move on to more fun things so we're just going to delete this right here and now I'm going to teach you how to tell the script I'm going to teach you how to tell this thing to add a new part into workspace so for example last time remember what we just did we clicked on home we clicked on part and then we added this thing right here and it was added right into workspace that's exactly what we just did right so now we're going to learn how to basically tell this script to do that for us so how do we tell this script to add a part and put it inside of workspace that's what we're about to learn right now so go back into your script window and just type EX exactly what I type local my part equals instance. new parentheses quotation marks part comma workspace now what in the world did I just type if you're like my friend Bob here your head is probably looking at that line of code and spinning just like this like don't worry I'll explain it to you so this right here instance. new this thing right here means Roblox creat something for me so in that new means I want to create a new instance of a part okay that's what that means I want to create a new instance of a part and I want to set that part's parent meaning I want to put that part inside of workspace let's do let me go through that again instance. new that means I want to create a new instance of a part and I want to put that part inside of workspace Now what is is workspace workspace is just this thing right here and if you remember when we clicked on part over here it literally just created a new part and it put it inside of workspace so that is why we have workspace right here so all we're saying with these two lines right here is I want to give everything to the right of this equal sign so I want to give this whole thing a nickname and I want the nickname of this thing to be that thing that's all we're saying so create a new part put it in workspace and give that part a nickname called my part hopefully that can make sense right hopefully that makes sense just creating a new part inside of workspace and we're just going to call it my part that's it so what's my part oh it's just a new part inside of workspace so if you click play would you look at that you have your part and also this is uh this is the old part let me actually get rid of that so all we're saying here with these two words is I want to give everything to the right of this equal sign so I want to give everything here a nickname and I want that nickname to be my part that's all it is that's all it is so we're saying let my part be equal to a new part inside of workspace does that make sense so a new part inside of workspace and we're just going to call it my part so what's my part it's just a new part inside of workspace that's all it is so now if you click play you can see there it is there's your part this right here this is my part see right there this my part this my part is referring to this part right here it's really really really simple now remember last time we also set this part's color to a different color we set it equal to that crazy word I couldn't pronounce at the beginning Canan right Canan yes that's what it was we set that Parts color to can and uh right here so we set this Parts color to C and what we did was we basically set the parts brick color to Canan that's all we did now what if I want this part's brick color to be set to this color right here well this brick color the name of this brick color is new yellow so if I wanted to set this part's brick color to a yellow color all I have to do is click here and then click on this yellow button right here and it sets the brick color to new yell but wait how on Earth do we do that with a script how on Earth do we do that with a script in a script there's no color button where I can just choose my color right so how on Earth do we do that well it's actually pretty simple we just have to my part remember my part is that part we just created and then dot now what is the thing that we're trying to change we're trying to change the color and specifically we're trying to change the brick color so you can just double click this or just type out brick color so my part. brick color equals and then brick color new parentheses quotation and right here you're just going to put the name of the brick color that you want to set it to so in our case we're going to use new yellow and this also has to be spelled exactly as it is shown over here so as you can see now my parts brick color is new yellow so if you click over here you can choose any color you want like our favorite give me a second Canan Canan that's how you say it just just like this science color right here you click it and then you click on whatever color you want and then remember the name of that so science c y a an and make sure that you spell this exactly as it's shown here so the C has to be Capital so instead of new yell maybe I want it to be a sign color I can just type it right here click play and there you have it there it is simple enough right let's do it one more time right from the beginning so remember we're going to start with local local my part this is the nickname so we're saying let my part be equal to a new instance instance. new a new instance of a part and put that part inside of workspace and then set my parts brick color to a new brick color and then you just put whatever brick color you want here so for example maybe toothpaste and then click on play and there you have it there's the part and as you can see if you click on the part inside of the the brick color you have toothpaste all right ready for the first quiz so I want this part to be a really red color Okay a really red color now when I say really red I mean really red whoop really red I want this part to have a brick color that is really red so hopefully that gives you enough information you can pause the video now I'm going to count to five and then I'm going to show you the solution so 1 2 3 4 5 five okay so this is how you do it so you just have to set this toothpaste it's really red that's it and then click play and there you have it the really red part is inside of workspace and there you go there you have it now if you got this quiz correct good job you've earned your first point you did it make sure you like the video Let's MO move on all right all right all right all right so we've done the brick color now what else can we do well let's click play here and here's my part now if you click on the part inside of properties you can actually see there's something called transparency and I really like this property because this is actually what I use during Halloween events to create spooky things like ghosts so what we're going to do is we're going to experiment with this so right now the transparency is zero what happens if I set it to 0.5 would you look at that part is now the part is now half visible right it's like half transparent now what do you think will happen if I set this 0.5 to 0.9 would you look at that now you can barely see the part it's it's there but like it's harder to see right now what do you think will happen if I set this part's transparency to 0.99 I can barely even see that it's there can you even see that I can't even I can't even tell where it is but if I walk around look at that see that bump yeah that that's where my part is okay that's pretty cool that's pretty cool so I hope you've noticed that if you have the transparency if you have this number be closer and closer to one then it becomes more and more invisible right so if you set the transparency to one then you can't see it at all it's completely invisible and if the transparency is zero then you can see the entire thing it's completely visible and any number in between you can use a slider right here any number in between will change the transparency and it will make it somewhat visible and somewhat invisible so just like that you can see the different effects of different numbers all right cool now how do you do that with a script well remember how we did brick color my part. brick color equals brick color. new something and then you just put whatever color you want over here well this is nice this is fun however for transparency it's a little bit different it's actually easier you don't need this brick color. new stuff you can just say my part my part. transparency equals and then you just have to give it whatever number you want so if I want the transparency to be 0.6 I just have to type it in here so all we're seeing here set the transparency of my part to 0.6 if you click play there you have it the part is now 0.6 transparency and whatever I set this number to will be the new transparency so if I set this to 0.2 then that will be the new transparency of my part so if you look over here you can see right here the transparency set to 0.2 which is the same number that I had over here all right cool I hope you're ready for your next Quiz so we're going to do this now so as I told you before I like Halloween I like transparency because this thing right here allows me to create something that I personally like to call a ghost part okay and what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you a ghost part I'm going to actually make one without using code and your challenge your quiz will be to code it okay so here's what a ghost part looks like home part and then the brick color is set to any white color so we can use ghost Gray so it could be a ghost gray color doesn't have to be white it kind of looks white or you can set it to like institutional white or Pearl any one of these three colors okay we're just going to use ghost gray because you know it's a ghost part but a ghost part is this whitish grayish color and it also has a transparency of 0.7 this right here I call this a ghost part hopefully you can see why because it looks kind of like a ghost part so once again the brick color is Ghost gray the transparency is 0.7 now you my friend go ahead and code it let's see what you come up with I'm going to give you 5 Seconds you can go ahead and pause the video and take as long as you need but I'm going to continue in 5 seconds so 5 4 3 2 1 all right let's continue all right so by now hopefully you've created your ghost part so now I'm going to teach you how I would do it so I'm just going to start from the beginning so my part equals instance. new part oh my goodness workspace and then my part. transparency equals 0.7 because it's a ghost part which I defined as having a transparency of 0.7 and then the my parts brick color is going to be a new brick color so brick color. new and then just call it ghost gray and there's how you could do it this is one way of doing it now of course you could have done the brick color first like this and then then the transparency you know whatever works with you it's okay as long as you created a ghost part and let's actually see what this looks like if we click the play button so I'm going to click play and here's my ghost part hopefully you guys were able to produce something like this if you were really really good job you you've been paying attention very actively and congratulations you got your second point so you're now at two points now of course that's assuming you got the first one but you know if you got this far you probably got the first one right so yeah you're probably at two points by now if you haven't gotten two points maybe this is a little bit tough it's okay it's totally fine we're just going to take things one step at a time and you will understand it even if you even if you didn't get the point for this one at least you understand how it works right that's the most important part all right now really quickly if you guys feel like you're learning really well so far I just want to give you two quick resources the first thing is completely free this is a Blog where I literally just write tutorial and I try to do this every single morning so here are some uh free Roblox scripting tutorials and there's actually a whole bunch of other stuff like all of this and there's actually a developers corner where you can find all of these other articles for example um you can learn about the Roblox algorithm you can learn about how you can motivate yourself to learn stuff whole bunch of really really cool and fun stuff for free so you get access to all of these articles for free I think there's like 38 articles so far completely for free you just have to to go in the link in the description and yeah now the second thing that you might like this one is paid if you want to support me and you feel like you've learning you've been learning really really well so far then you might be interested in this book that I wrote this is the uh beginner guide to Roblox scripting book and basically the book is structured in a way where every single line is explained to you there's vocabulary lists at the end of every chapter with tons and tons of code samples there's quizzes just like what you're doing right now and everything is explained to you in way where you can understand it and then at the end of the at the end of the book there's actually a chapter where you'll be able to code your own admin commands from scratch like completely from scratch where you will be able to do it all by yourself so if that sounds like something you'd be interested in make sure you check the other Link in the description and let's resume all right so that's cool and all but what if I want to change the shape of this thing like what if I don't want this rectangular prism looking thing maybe I want this thing to be a different shape well if you scroll down you you see there's a property called shape instead of block you have all of these options right here so I can make it a ball I can make it a wedge I can make it a cylinder I can make it a corner wedge so this is like a special type of wedge and there's all these options so let's start with ball so how would you actually script this how would you create a ball well think about it isn't this isn't the quiz yet but think about it you have the part and we had just set the shape to ball now remember what if we wanted to change transparency we just had to do my part. transparency equals and then maybe like 0.5 well wouldn't it seem probable that if you want to change the shape of this my part you could just do something like my part do shape and then equals ball like shouldn't that just work well yes this is very very very close except that Roblox thinks that this ball is a name a nickname Roblox thinks this is a nickname just like how we've set this part's nickname to my part Roblox think this ball is a nickname for something which isn't right this is not this is not a nickname so we have to do is we have to put this in quotation marks and this basically tells Roblox this is not a nickname this is a string a string is anything in quotation marks so right here get so we actually have two strings in this code right here we have ball which is a string and part which is a string anything with quotation marks is a string so now if you run this we should we should have a ball which is 50% transparent and that's exactly what we have here now one thing that you've probably noticed is this right here this the ball just okay I must have kicked it well one thing that you might have noticed is this stud looking thing right here this you know those things in Legos that have those uh those I don't know what they're called but this this thing right here the stud looking thing if you want to get rid of it roblox actually has something called material and you just have to set the material to smooth plastic and it'll go away so once again material by default Roblox sets it to plastic uh it's right here it looks like this but if you want this thing to be gone you just have to set it to smooth plastic and it has to be spelled like this now how do you think we change the material well how did we change the shape just do the same thing my part dot material equals and you'd probably think oh I would just type smooth plastic here right and this is very probable this is this is what anyone would do however once again Roblox thinks this is a variable Roblox thinks this is a nickname for something but that's not the case so we have to tell Roblox to string and that's how we do it and this right here will create an awesome ball which doesn't have any um stud looking things on it so this is a smooth plastic ball all right quiz number three let's here's some opportunity to earn another point I want you guys to code this it's going to be a red ball just like this I want you guys to code this right here this is a really red ball with the material as smooth plastic so I want it to look just like that so go ahead and pause the video and I will show the solution in 5 4 3 2 1 all right cool here's how you would Cod it so you have your part you can just do the same thing that we did before so my part. shape equals ball or you could have set the color to red or you know the material to smooth plastic it doesn't matter what order you do it in as long as you have it like this smooth plastic and then my part do brick color equals brick color. new really red just like that and that's how you create the red ball which is right here all right now we're going to make things really really really really fun okay now it's going to get really really cool this is going to be awesome like trust me just keep watching okay all right so I don't know if you guys have noticed yet but whenever we create anything using a script it just seems to place the ball right over here right like isn't that just an odd spot why is it over here why doesn't it just put the ball like over here or like up in the sky right well that's just how Roblox does it but as scriptor we can tell Roblox to do other things so I want this ball to from now on I want this ball to spawn all the way over here and it's okay if it falls because you know gravity but I want this ball to spawn like over here and I want it to fall just like that how do you think I could do that well we have something called position which is right here so if you scroll down under the properties of your part long as as long as it's selected here you can scroll down you'll see position which is right here and this position right here basically defines where this ball is and this position this position is three different numbers so we have x y and z now y right here this basically means where it is up and down okay think about it like that where is this ball located up and down and if you set this y to 10 guess what this is now 10 units above the ground that's what that means when Y is set to 10 it's now 10 units up there okay and what if I set y to 50 well now it's 50 units up there and what if I set y to 100 well now it's going to fall all the way from the sky right and this x and z right here just tell you how far away it is on the left and right so for example if you set this to 10 the ball moved right if you set this back to zero the ball is left if you set this to like 20 the ball went all the way over here what if I set this to 50 well now the ball's all the way over there right so that's on the left and right and the Z is on the front and back so maybe I'll set this to five as you can see it went five backward you can set it to -10 and then went forward because it's negative and you know you can just mess around with these but for for now all we care about is this y all we care about is going up and down okay so if you set this to 500 it's falling from the sky I don't know right there see it boom boom and it just bounces and now if you want to set the position so what we just saw of anything you're going to do my part of of any like part then you're going to do my part. position equals and then remember we had to give it three numbers right so we had to actually give the part so when we created a part we had to give it three numbers so right here position it wants three numbers it wants an X a y and a z and we can't just so we can't just say 050 we can't just do this and the reason is because Roblox wants us to use something called a vector 3 Vector 3. new just like what we did with brick color. new remember remember we did my part. brick color equals brick color. new and then we said something like really red just like this right here we're just using something called a vector 3 that's all it is and we're using position so this right here this means go 50 up okay 50 studs up so 50 above the ground and if I run this it's going to create a part and it's going to spawn it 50 studs above the ground so if I click play it actually fell okay let me try it again with 500 to really show it to you so it's going to actually spawn all the way in the sky and as you can see it just clovered me it's just bouncing on my head so that basically means spawned apart all the way in the sky that's what this 500 means so 5 500 is the distance from the ground all the way to the sky or from the ground to where that part is spawned so if I want to spawn anything that falls from the sky you just have to set I just have to set this y right here to a really high number like if you set it to 900 then it's going to fall like all the way from the sky like it's falling from space so that's how you can make anything fall from the sky so you know what I want you to do for the next Quiz I want you to create a falling red ball okay so hopefully you understood that right a falling red ball so basically what we just created but I want it to fall from the sky that's it go ahead falling red ball from the sky make sure the material smooth plastic and pause the video go ahead and try it out 1 2 3 4 five all right here's how you do it my part. brick color equals brick color. new really red remember this is a really red ball my part. shape is equal to ball and then my part. material is equal to smooth plastic and lastly the new line of code is we just have to add this right here which basically makes the ball fall from the sky as you can see and it fell from the sky and because it's a ball it's literally just rolling away all right so that's how you do it now the last part is I'm going to teach you about something called a for Loop now this is going to be a little bit challenging for some people but bear with me I think you're going to understand it do you remember in the beginning of the video we had print hello world right we had this thing right here print hello world and what did this do well it basically printed hello world onto the output right so when you click play it just put hello world there and remember that we did a Goodbye World here too so whatever you put in here will go right in here so if you put Goodbye World there you go there's Goodbye World now I want what if I want to print hello world but I want to print it a 100 times well one way of doing it is by torturing yourself and by manually typing it all out right so I can literally just type out print hello world and I can do this 100 times and that would really suck now a better way of doing it is by copying it and then pasting it and then you're just doing this 100 times so look at the line number on the left side right here you can see this is the 12th line that means I've done it 12 times and I can just keep on doing this but an even better way that I'm about to teach you is by using something called a for Loop so if I want this to print 10 times I can just do this and it's just going to print it 10 times so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 if I click play there you have it 10 times hello world has been printed now if I want to do this 10 times I can actually do it in an easier way by using something called a for Loop so a for Loop goes like this and then I can type print hello world so let me actually explain what all of this means so this four right here means I want to create a for Loop a for Loop is basically something that tells Roblox to do something over and over and over again so I want to create a new for Loop you don't have to worry about this I so 4 I equal 1 means start at 1 and then stop at 10 and then do whatever is in here okay so whatever is in between this do and this end will happen 10 times and how do I know it's going to happen 10 times because this number is 10 right here so we're starting at one and then we're going to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and that's going to stop so this right here basically says print hello world 10 times that's all it means so if I click play it printed hello world 10 times as you can see right here so what if I want to print hello world 90 times well I don't have to do copy and pasting right I don't have to copy and paste I can just set this to 90 it's going to print hello world 90 times and there you have it as you can see that's a lot of hello worlds right 90 times s I've printed hello world and I didn't even have to copy and paste it's genius it's absolutely genius now here we go this is going to be great this is going to be a little bit of a challenge let me give you a quick hint first so what if I want to spawn 90 parts so remember we don't just have to print 90 things we can do other things right what if I want to spawn 90 Parts well local my part equals instance. new part workspace there you have it this is going to spawn 90 parts okay I'm going to click part I'm going to click play and there you have it 90 Parts have spawned it's actually really really cool now some of you are going to go oh wow that's pretty cool what if I set this to 90 bajillion and then this is going to like probably crash your Roblox studio so you probably don't want to do this but this right here is going to create 90 instances of this part so hopefully this makes sense to you so what if I want to make 200 I just have to set this to 200 and then it creates 200 Parts Little more laggy right this is a lot of parts all right last and final quiz for the fifth point I want you guys to spawn 200 falling red balls yes 200 yes it's going to it's going to look cool too okay trust me so I'm going to tell you that you don't have to change anything here and you don't have to change anything here you just type all your code here type all of your code here and it will work fine so go ahead try it out pause the video I'm going to give you the answer in 5 seconds so pause the video 1 2 3 4 5 all right let's do this so you have a for Loop right here so this is saying do it 200 times and then set the parts brick color to Brick color. New really red my part do um hold on oh yeah we're creating balls shape equals ball and then my part down material equals smooth plastic and then and the last thing is we have to set the position and I'm going to use 300 you could have as long as your part spawns and Falls it's okay I'm actually going to use 600 to illustrate my point this will create six or two this will create 200 falling red balls let's try it okay ready set go uh-oh I'm about to get yeah that's that's actually that let's actually verify that's 200 yep 200 Parts those are all 200 parts now really quickly that might have you know that might have looked a little bit weird to you I'm going to introduce you to something called task. weight this right here tells Roblox to wait so this right here is telling Roblox to wait 1 second so create a red ball and then wait 1 second it's going to do it again so it's going to create a red ball wait 1 second create a red ball wait 1 second create a red ball wait 1 second create a red ball wait one sec it's going to do it 200 times so it's going to keep on doing that and we call that a loop you know what we call it a loop because it starts here goes here and then it goes back to where it started like a loop and now if you click play my character will get hit by many many many oh they're actually colliding with each other so that it's going to spawn 200 balls just like that and there you have it and if you actually set this to like 0.05 I'm actually going to run this in a different way you can see the actual 200 red balls that have been created by our Cod wow they're actually wow they're actually lining up quite straight wait why aren they falling wait wait wait wait oh my God that's so many wow is this like perfectly balanced okay well there you have it 200 red balls I really hope you guys enjoy this video make sure to like And subscribe and I'll see you in the next video	33147	t	The content addresses the high-intent 'beginner intimidation' pain point by providing a step-by-step, confidence-building introduction to Roblox Studio and basic scripting.

9v3GvfX_qr8	🔥 How to Make an Obby on Roblox Studio | Beginners Scripting Tutorial 🎮	AlvinBlox	530777	16:21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v3GvfX_qr8	roblox scripting tutorial	in this video I'm going to show you how to create an obstacle course on Roblox so the first thing you want to do is when you open up Roblox Studio the app which you need to create a Roblox game which will be linked in the description you need to click on the new button and select base plate once you've done that you'll see this screen we've got some panels here on the side one is the Explorer that allows us to see all of the objects in our game if you click on the Arrow where it says workspace you'll see we've got a base plate spawn location camera and terrain now if you don't see this panel the Explorer panel all you need to do is head to the top left corner of Roblox Studio go to view and make sure that Explorer and properties are selected and then down here in the bottom right we've got the properties window again these might be in a separate location but if you can see them on the screen that's all you need the properties window is where we can customize the appearance and behavior of any objects in the game which is going to be crucial for creating an Obby so let's get started by selecting the base plate and the spawn location we're going to right click and delete them for now now you'll see that this leaves us with nothing in the game world that's fine because what we can do is we can head up to the top of Roblox Studio select the Home tab and insert a part so if you just click on the part button you can see we have a new part which has been generated and this is going to be our lobby spawn area so let's use the four tools up here underneath the Home tab select move scale and rotate to manipulate this part so I'm going to select the scale tool this allows us to resize the part and you can see here that we've now got these handles on our part so we can drag and make our part bigger and then what I want to do is because this is going to be a platform that players stand on we want it to be stuck in the air we don't want it to fall and destroy itself when the game begins so let's head to the properties panel because I've just said the properties panel is what we use to control the appearance or in this case the behavior of our object we want to scroll down to where it says anchored you want to make sure anchored is selected make it checked this just means that when the game starts this part isn't going to fall out of the world next what we need to do is insert a spawn on top of this part so that players will be positioned in this lobby area so if we head back to our top area here on this menu bar and if we select the model tab this time and just move over here you can see it says spawn so this is underneath the model tab so if we click on spawn you can see a spawn has been added to the game and we can just drag this and place it on top of our lobby all right let's see what works so far let's head back to the tabs area here let's go to the Home tab and click on play now what should happen is our character should spawn on our spawn point there we go so we've created the lobby part for our Hobby now it's time to create some actual obstacles so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this part which is our lobby area I'm going to right click and I'm going to duplicate it okay you can also press Ctrl D on the keyboard but I've just made a duplicate of it and then I'm going to select the move tool up here because I want to move this part and then we're just going to drag the blue handle and I'm going to create a jump okay so this is a jump that a player is going to have to navigate now I'm going to use the scale tool up here and I'm just going to make this second part a little bit smaller okay so this is our jump we don't need to worry about the anchored property because it's still the same it's checked just like this other part because this is a duplicate so what we can now do is select the move tool again I'm going to go back and I'm going to press Ctrl D on the keyboard or command D if you're on a Mac to duplicate this jump okay I've pressed it and I'm just going to move it along here I'm going to create a few jumps this is going to be our first obstacle so you can just keep pressing the duplicate key or you can right click of course and select duplicate it's up to you I'm just going to keep on doing these for a few more jumps there we go so this is going to be our first obstacle now if you'd like you can change the color of these parts all you have to do is click on the select tool and then select the parts that you want to color and then once it's selected you see this blue box outline you then just want to head down to the properties panel and underneath brick color you can choose a color here and you can see in the corner that it's actually changing the color so I can do a red part and I can do the same for all these other ones as well so there we go I've just selected each individual part gone to the properties window down here and changed that brick color property you could also change the color property which lets you make them a little bit more detailed so it's up to you and again if you don't see the properties window or the Explorer panel do not worry all you need to do is just head up to the top left here click on view and make sure that these two are selected alright now that we've created our first obstacle I'm going to go back over here take our little platform right click duplicate it again and I'm going to use the move tool to just bring it over here so this is going to be a little rest area a little platform for our players to chill on before they take the next obstacle so let's create that next obstacle now there's going to be a choose path now you've probably seen these before it's going to be three different paths and only one of them is going to be the correct path the other two the player will fall through them if they choose that path so what I'll do is I'm going to select this part we're going to duplicate it so Ctrl D or command D and then using the move tool I'm just going to move it to the very edge here okay and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the scale tool because we want to change the size so using the scale tool I'm just going to make this about a third of the width of this platform here okay and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click duplicate select the move tool and bring it back over here okay and I'm going to do the exact same thing again right click duplicate and bring this over now just to make this in the middle of the two of the parts I'm just going to head to the model tab I'm going to uncheck this box where it says snap to grid underneath move so I'm going to uncheck move and this will just let us have some free movement it's not going to lock it to studs so I can finally set the position of this middle part now that we've got our three paths I said I only want one of them to be walkable so I'm going to select the other two paths so I want the part the path in the middle to be walkable okay now if we select this part you'll see in the properties window which controls the behavior of these parts that can Collide is set to true and this is going to be really important this part because if we just move over here so you can see it there we go so you can see this one in the middle the can Collide is set to true we want to keep that the same we want to keep this checked because can Collide means that you can walk over the parts if we were to set this can Collide property to unchecked it would mean that you'd fall straight through it when you try to walk over it so since I want this middle part to be the correct path I'm going to firstly select the other two okay so I've selected them both by holding down control or command on my keyboard I've just selected them I'm going to uncheck and Collide okay so now these two paths the one on the left and the one on the right the plan will fall straight through if they try to walk on them but of course the player doesn't know that they'll just have to try this obstacle a couple of times until they realize which path is the right one and just like before we can select each heart head to the properties window and change the brick color so I can set this one to be red this one can be green and this one can be yellow okay so now that we've done that we've created our first choose path we can do the same thing again we can just take these three blocks by using the select tool up here and we can just drag to select all four we've got three paths and one platform and then we can right click duplicate that's going to create a duplication of all four parts and then we can go back up here to use the move tool and since they're all still selected we can just move them over now I'm going to head back to the snap to grid and in the model tab here and just set that to be checked again because I want it to lock to one stood when I move it and then we can just drag our duplicate Parts over here and this time I want this uh far right part to be the correct path so I'm going to set that one's can Collide to be true down here okay and then the other two I'm going to select by holding down control or command and heading back to the properties window you can see it's got a subtract or a line through the box that means one of them's can collide one of them isn't at the moment so if I just check that if I click it sorry it's going to uncheck it so both these two the red and the green are now going to be the incorrect paths because we've set their can Collide to be false this one on the right is the correct one and I'm also going to change the colors of these because why not we can have a blue one we can have a pink one and we can have another yellow one okay and if you want you can do one more but I think two is enough just because it's going to take the player a few tries anyway to work this out so I'm going to go back and take one of my platforms over here right click duplicate I'm going to use the move tool and just bring this over here okay so there we go our second obstacle is completed let's have a quick playthrough of our hobby to make sure everything's working so I'm gonna head back up here to the Home tab and then just over here underneath the test section I'm going to click on play this is going to spawn us into the game you can see we're here at the spawn point let's give our jumps a go so are there just about five or six studs spaced out which is just enough for the player so that is a uh a tested fully tested obstacle we know that one works and then we've got our choose path so we've got the the path down the middle which is the correct one and we've got this one on the right as well which is the correct one but any other path oh oh there we go here we go yeah any other path that we that we try and walk through will just uh we'll just fall straight through and we'll die so all good it seems like the hobby is working so far let's now create our final obstacle now the final obstacle is going to be some lava jumps so I'm going to take this platform select it and then up here we're going to select the scale tool and I'm going to extend this platform to allow us to place our lava bricks on top of them now we need to insert another part so let's head back up here and choose part that's going to spawn this part on top of our platform so we can just take it move it to the edge and make it span the entire width of this platform then we can go down to the properties window and where it says brick color we can set that to Red I'm also going to set the material to be neon if you have a look you can see I've now got a bright shiny red lava Block in fact I'm going to make this a little bit harder and extend the width and height of this lava jump alright now I'm just going to go back and select the move tool and I'm just going to space this out a little bit so the player's got some room and then I'm going to keep right clicking and duplicating to place down some more lava bricks all right so here are all my lava bricks but there's one last thing we need to do we need to make the player die when they step on these lava jumps so how do we do that well it's rather easy all we need to do is Select them all so I'll select one two three four holding down control or command if you're on a Mac so they're all selected and then in the Explorer panel I'm going to right click and select group as a folder then in the properties window I can name this folder lava bricks and then all we now need to do is back in the Explorer if we go to server script service we'll click on this plus and search for a script now make sure you insert this gray script here and then you'll see the code editor has opened up I'm just going to hide this Banner here and even if you've not written any code before don't worry we're just going to write some simple code which will make the player die when they step on a lava brick so here's the code you need to write so here is the code firstly you don't have to write out these green comments they're just there to help explain what's going on so firstly we create a variable to easily reference our folder over here in the workspace we then Loop through every single lava brick in that folder and for each one we detect when the lava brick has been stepped on which gives us the object that touched the brick now it could be a player it could be some other object in the game so we have to make sure that it is a player by doing a check here which will return true or false and if it is a potential player then we're going to set the health of that player's humanoid which is in their character to zero which is going to kill them now there'll be a link to this code in the description alternatively you can just pause the video and copy it out for yourself but make sure that you spell everything correctly just like I have here because a simple typo can cause your script to break now for this to work you'll have to make sure that all of your parts are in a folder called lava bricks with a space in between the lava and bricks and obviously a capital l and capital B for lava and Bricks but once you've done that your lava bricks should be good to go now let's see if they work I'm going to click on play here up here underneath the Home tab that will teleport you to the exact location where you want to spawn so if you click on that little arrow underneath play here and select play here because you may be set to play rather than play here it will spawn you wherever your character what your camera is facing so if you just move your camera over here you will spawn at the lava bricks and now if we step on our lava bricks you can see it kills us so we've got our three obstacles here and it takes us back to the start when you finish now you may be wondering how to add checkpoints and I actually made another video showing how to do this and I'll be creating an updated version in the meantime as well so I'll leave a link to that for you to go and watch but that's it for this video you've just learned how to make a very simple Hobby in Roblox studio in just

4xUg9yZGiMQ	The EASIEST Way to Learn Scripting (Roblox)	RoDev	406290	4:27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUg9yZGiMQ	roblox scripting tutorial	with just a computer access to the internet and some scripting you can truly create your own front page game learning the script isn't too hard and if i could go back in time this is exactly how i would do it this video is broken up into a few sections including your mindset learning scripting and your developer environment it's definitely hard but if you're willing to put in just a little bit of work you can learn how to script by yourself in just as little as a month so whether you're a builder ui designer or have no roblox development experience this video is meant for you let's get into it mindset scripters and programmers alike think differently when it comes to solving problems we approach our lives and problems in a certain way i can confidently say that my day-to-day life became different when i learned how to script we know and understand that no matter how difficult the problem is there is always a solution adopt a coding mindset for every problem annoyance or task even outside of the script editor and roblox studio as someone who wants to learn how to script you need to begin thinking and get into the mindset that there is always a solution you just have to find it whether that solution takes a few seconds minutes hours or even days to solve there's always a solution this means that the internet is your best friend your keyboard is broken don't worry pull up youtube and search for a fix windows blue screen don't worry google windows blue screen with the error of the screen gave you problem solving the reason a lot of people quit scripting is because they get stuck on a really huge bug and literally rage quit as a scripter you need to believe that you can solve the problem at 3 am working on something like a buggy pet system the only thing that keeps me moving is the fact that there is a solution i just need to find it the next thing i want to cover is that the computer is always right if you're ever working from a tutorial and it works for the person in the video but something goes wrong on your end you can't blame the computer you copied something wrong this happens far too often even on this channel as i make tutorials coding is just a tool for problem solving it's actually just the easy part the part where you need to solve the problem is the hard part it's the part where again most people quit scripting you don't have to know the whole lua u library heck guys i don't even know the whole louie library what you do need to know is the problem-solving part once you have that down coding becomes the easy part learning this section of the video will guide you on what you need to do in order to learn scripting and how i would have done it if i could go back in time first get familiar with a certain strand of scripting learn a certain side of scripting and get comfortable with it it doesn't have to be what you use in the future or what you even want to do find something easy like data store service and master it to be honest i wish i had done something easy first and then moved on to step two after you master that one thing branch out for example player service and data store service go hand in hand then connect that to something like gui and use that to branch into remote events local scripts and scripting the ui on players screens one thing i want to add before the next section is that you are always learning after a year of commissions i'm still learning and it won't ever stop that brings us to the next section personal projects now that you have knowledge of front end local scripts and ui and back end like saving data start making a personal project this right here is mine now it's not the best game on roblox but it's better than what a scripter who just started without the help of this video could make by themselves and i'm proud of it now it doesn't have to be a simulator but it can be anything you want i would personally now do an hobby that saves your stages and spawns you at the stage you left at for my first personal project your developer environment your dev environment is one of the most important things you should be taking care of roblox studio really limits us and you don't want to get into rojo and visual studio code at this point so i recommend taking 5 to 10 minutes and customizing roblox studio to your liking remember you don't have to copy me and you can use whatever works best for you congrats remember coding is problem solving typing is the easy part by this point you are well on your way to becoming a scripter you think about things the right way and you have the motivation and patience it takes to solve problems i truly believe in you guys good luck out there	4677	t	The content addresses the high barrier to entry and common 'quit points' for new developers by providing a structured roadmap and

GE6Z1n57yDU	How to ACTUALLY LEARN to Script in Roblox Studio (5 Steps to learn)	MikoLikesHat	389531	13:06	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE6Z1n57yDU	roblox scripting tutorial	Have you ever wondered why some people learn to script faster than you? They make cool games and you don't because you think you are too dumb. Yeah, me too. Let's get to the point of this video. You've probably been learning to script for months or even years and now you think you're ready to make a game. But when you try to create a game on your own without tutorials or guides, you realize you don't understand everything. You start thinking you've only learned a little and that you need to spend more hours watching tutorials. Well, I don't want to scare you, but you've been learning the wrong way all this time. Let me give you an example. All right, tell me what's your method for learning to script. I know you understand a little about scripting. So, oh, well, look, I started scripting by checking out this uh free model. Then I did a quick search to see what each function does. And then I kept repeating that process until I found some YouTube tutorial. Okay, enough. I get it. Now let me ask you, do you really understand what you're doing when you script? Tell me, is Lua the same as Lu? What is Lua and Lua? Oh god, have you been memorizing everything without actually understanding the concepts behind what you're doing? Yeah, I just write whatever fits the code. Consider yourself lucky again for the fourth time. I'm actually going to teach you how to properly learn to code. Not like those money hungry people who just want to take your money. I know you've already spent a lot of money in the past, so don't fall for that again. If I still don't understand after you teach me, does that mean I'm too dumb? Nah, you just need practice and patience, even if that sounds generic. Hey, welcome to this video. As you probably saw in the title, you might feel like your progress in learning to code is too slow or that you're not actually learning anything. If that's the case, you've found the right video. I'm going to teach you five ways or good practices to actually learn coding without wasting hours watching or reading information that doesn't truly help you improve. Just an important thing, don't blindly follow every instruction or step I show in this video. Everyone has a different learning path. It may be slower or faster, but the point is that by the end of this video, you actually learn something valuable. But before we begin, if you already know a bit about scripting, I also recommend checking out this video. You might be making mistakes without even realizing it. Now, enjoy the video. Before you start, or if you're already learning, you need to understand this concept, which in my opinion is the most important thing you need to know. You don't need to be a tech nerd to understand this. So, I will explain this in the easiest way possible because this may be a little complex for you, especially if it's your first time. Core programming refers to the basic and essential concepts that you need to understand before you start coding or building something. In a few words, they are rules. And if you asking what are these important concepts, let me explain them. The most important ones are problem solving. This is crucial on your journey to becoming a scriptor. You need to know that programming or scripting is about solving problems. Every task and every line of code you write will require you to use your brain. You may think it's like math or building Lego pieces. And yes, you're right. Variables and data types. These little things called variables are really important if you want to store information in your code and also help the machine understand what you're doing. The most common or most used are primitive data types which are number, boolean, string, nil, table, function. Roblox lu also has custom data types like vector 3, frame, instance. These are familiar if you've used other game engines. Conditional logic. This is also important when you're scripting. You want the machine to make decisions based on conditions and the instructions you've given. The most common conditions are if else if. So basically these are the most important concepts in my opinion. With these three steps you can easily understand Lu syntax which is the fundamental structure of the programming language you're learning. I could add more about core programming, but since this is not an advanced tutorial on scripting, these three are enough. You already know what this means, but I'll explain it anyway. On your journey to becoming a scriptor, you must choose the right learning resource to gain experience and knowledge. If you're wondering how many learning resources exist, there are actually a lot. the official Roblox documentation, online courses, YouTube tutorials. Which one should you stick with? In my opinion, if you're a beginner, you should start with YouTube tutorials as a guide. Tutorials help you understand new concepts and get familiar with scripting. But, and this is important, do not rely with tutorials forever. Why? Because, as I mentioned before, problem solving is a crucial skill in coding. Many tutorials walk you through everything step by step, which is fine for learning something new. However, your goal should be to train your brain and improve your problem solving skills. If you keep relying on tutorials, you might end up in something called tutorial hell. And trust me, you don't want to be stuck there. If I stayed in that loop, I wouldn't be making this video in 2025. What about the Roblox documentation? Documentation is also a great way to learn. This is recommended more for intermediate or experienced scriptors. I really, really recommend the Roblox developer hub. Everything you want to know about scripting is there. Even though I am an advanced scriptor, I still use it not to learn but to memorize because sometimes you can forget things. This may look boring to you because there's a lot of text, but trust me, the Roblox documentation is a very good way to learn. and courses. I don't know what to say about them. I watched some courses and uh they're kind of good. I think the main problem is that Roblox scripting courses are usually bad. They are weird at explaining things. Some are overpriced. Many don't offer a challenge to the viewer. Should I recommend it? Maybe if you have extra money, but if I were you, I'd rather spend it on learning another programming language instead. In summary, if you are a beginner, you must use YouTube tutorials as a guide, not a learning resource to gain a lot of experience. And then if you already understand what you are doing and learning, stick with the Roblox documentation or learn Lua. But but tutorials are more fun and some people are so good that they put the code in the comments. I don't understand it, but it works in my game, I think. Avoid those types of tutorials, too. They probably stole it from another talented coder. What? Hear me out. This is the part where I really started to learn how to script and I don't want you to waste a lot of time. So, what do I mean by challenge learning? It's about solving problems. Do you remember that problem solving is really important? Yeah, I've said that like three times. So, how do you apply this then? Pretty easy. Everything you learn from YouTube tutorials, the Roblox documentation, or any learning resource should be applied without memorizing it, by testing your skills. Think of it like a ranked match just with the difference that you actually gain experience instead of just a rank. I will give an example. Noob watches a tutorial about variables and after watching it, he applies what he learned without checking or re-watching the tutorial. He struggles and that's the point. You should struggle. Your brain will be working hard to figure things out. If you get really stuck, you can check the Roblox documentation, but not the video. Oh, did you learn something after uh 6 hours? I was about to hit my head against the table, but actually after experimenting with this, I finally understand how variables work. All right, now repeat this process for the whole month. You've literally learned just 1% of scripting. Good job. I really recommend following this step. It's the most fun and motivating of all the steps I've shown. The satisfaction after working hard and seeing that beautiful code is worth it. Like I said before, you must spend your time challenging yourself. You shouldn't start with your dream game or watch a ton of tutorials thinking you'll automatically learn to script like a machine. Start with small and simple projects. They can be really basic like your own admin commands, a clicker game, parkour mechanics, an interactive NPC system, really anything. The point is to apply everything you've learned throughout your journey. This process needs to be fun and rewarding. The goal of learning is that you shouldn't feel frustrated. If you do, your brain might start to hate scripting, and that's why you never truly learn. I know you need to work really hard because coding isn't easy. But if you enjoy the process, it will be much more effective. Having a positive mindset in any ability you're learning, in this case, scripting. If you ask why you should change your mindset to a positive one, then let me explain. Having a negative mindset, which probably applies to most people watching this video, can be a major setback for your progress. You might start experiencing fear of making mistakes and probably give up on scripting. And that's not something you want. You actually want to learn, right? I used to compare myself to others thinking, why does everyone learn faster than me? Is it because they were born with that talent? I was very, very wrong that day. What you need to know is this. Remind yourself that struggling is normal. I'm not saying you should ignore the bad things. You should improve and learn from them. But while maintaining a positive mindset, of course. As for the benefits of having a positive mindset, there are many. Your motivation boost will be huge and that's the goal. Most people watching this video want to learn to script fast, right? It also reduces frustration, making the learning process more enjoyable, as I mentioned before. So change your mindset. Stop being so negative. Most people don't like being around that mindset. Just be a happy person. Don't pretend to be a happy person anyways. So in conclusion, to summarize all those steps, learn the basics about core programming. You can search it on Google to find out what it actually means and learn it from any learning resource you like. Choose the right learning resource depending on your scripting level and how efficient it is for you. Start making challenges to test your scripting skills. See how much you progress and improve your problem solving skills which are really important. Start with simple and challenging projects to test how you manage making a game by yourself. Don't make it too big. At least something short but fun to test. And the last one, change your mindset to a positive one to boost your learning progress and your mental health. Yes, I care about your mental health. As I said at the start of the video, following these steps in order isn't really necessary. You may have already completed any of these steps without knowing. If you think there's something missing, don't be scared to put it in the comments. Everyone should learn, you know. I don't have much more to say.

QpY8CPo1WXM	How To Master Roblox Scripting (Even If You're Lost!)	SmartyRBX	216846	6:55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpY8CPo1WXM	roblox scripting tutorial	yo are you feeling stuck with Roblox scripting you want to get started but you have no idea where to even begin trust me I've been there but stick around because by the end of this video you'll know exactly how to start scripting on Roblox even if you've never written a single line of code in your life we're going to cover everything from the basics of how to learn scripting to monetizing your skills so let's dive in so I'm smarty RBX and I'm the creator of the number one scripting guide in the world I've taught millions of developers how to script on Roblox and today I'm going to share with you a stepbystep guide on how to get started right now no fluff no wasting time just the real steps you need to take to learn scripting on Roblox so let's get started first things first if you're watching this video and you haven't seen my beginner guide on how to script on Roblox start with that if you watch that video you will learn all the basics you need to get started in Roblox scripting like the syntax the basic concepts and how to start piecing those skills together into full scripts you can open the video in the top right hand corner in a new tab and start learning but don't just watch the video Start scripting now follow along and you'll see how quickly you'll improve as a scripter so the second second tip is to stop focusing on making games when you start if you're watching this you probably want to make Roblox games you want to make entire games on the platform and that's great but if you've just started the first thing you should do is simply replicate simple features you like from your favorite games on Roblox you could go into pet simulator 99 and you could look at the button animations or the way that they have the UI up when you get near the eggs to buy them if you use your scripting skills to recreate these simple systems it's one of the best ways to learn more about scripting and develop your skills and it doesn't need to be perfect it just needs to be good practice this approach is a way to make scripting less intimidating and way more fun instead of making a big game first start simple make pieces of games and then once you do this enough you'll realize that you now have the skill to make entire games but right now start simple and use this approach to improve your skills gradually tip three be okay with looking things up when I started as a scriptor in 2021 I remember that I used to worry about looking things up all the time I used to think that I wasn't as good of a scripter if I had to look things up but as I went on in scripting I began to notice that every scriptor looks things up Pro scriptors still still look things up as they code nobody knows everything I don't know everything Preston from big games doesn't know everything and hm doesn't know everything either so if you're watching this understand that it is okay to look things up as you script and not just okay but it's a good thing when you look at the Roblox documentation when you use AI as a resource when you even ask a friend or someone in smarty devs join our Discord below by the way how to script something you aren't less of a script you're becoming a better scriptor because you are learning use your resources all you can and don't rely on things too much the difference between a noob scriptor who doesn't know what he's doing and a PR scriptor is not that the noob uses resources but the proscriptor doesn't no it's that the proscriptor also goes the extra mile to understand the resources and understand how the code works at a deeper level many developers they make the mistake of watching these videos on how to make a tycoon and then they just copy the code and don't think about how it works and don't try to figure out how everything works together in the script it's not surprising that these developers don't learn anything that's the real mistake so use your resources but the key is to make sure that you understand the code as well and if you do that you'll always be on the right track now the next point I'm about to tell you is very Rel ated it's to use AI as a tool not a replacement leverage AI to improve your scripting but don't rely on it use it to suggest improvements debug and optimize and also learn new things about scripting but remember AI is not your replacement it's your assistant you are the one creating not the AI it's okay to use AI it's a great resource whether you use chat GPT or the RO blocks AI that they have on the create page it's good to use your resources including AI but not to rely on it too much remember how I just told you the key is to use your resources but also make sure that you understand how the code works as well when you use AI it's the same thing ask it questions but also make sure that you look at what the AI is doing you could even ask it why it's making its certain decisions why did you use this code oh why did you use this instead of this why do you use a function here instead of just writing the code without a function these are the questions that will help you to improve as a scripter rather than using AI as a crutch now tip five if you're watching this far I'll bet you are very serious about taking your skills to the next level on Roblox and if that's you and you want to learn even more about scripting and do it with more efficiency join my course scripting SE Secrets you'll get access to lessons that will help you to speed up your scripting process so much faster and don't just take my word for it we have tons of testimonials saying it was the fastest path they could find to learn scripting to a great level and way way more so if you want to learn scripting even faster join scripting Secrets now and I'll be honest I can't guarantee you anything it's you as to put in the work to become a great scriptor my course is a resource just like the video you're watching right now if you want to reach your goals in scripting and development you have to take action on the advice that I'm sharing with you so just start and I can't wait to see how far you go in Roblox scripting and what you create watch the video on screen now to learn even more about how to become a highlevel Roblox developer	6210	t	This content addresses high-volume

IzjHaeRpFz8	Why Roblox Studio is Confusing For Beginners	ByteBlox	190095	15:22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzjHaeRpFz8	roblox scripting tutorial	we also have secret which at this point I just think Roblox is trolling us like this this cannot be a real thing this thing has literally stolen The Souls of so many developers I can't even start counting the main thing that makes Roblox stand out from stuff like Unity um you know God dot Unreal Engine 5 is that Roblox is stupid which leaves developers confused not because it's like you know complex or anything cuz it's not complex right it's really simple but just because it has basically no patterns and the moment it actually starts forming a pattern and you can somewhat follow it it just breaks it off completely because most developers look for patterns so they're like okay well if this does this thing well then this similar thing probably does a similar thing and Roblox like somewhat somewhat follows this until it just says actually no you so I'm going to start with what I know for a fact every single person who's ever touched Roblox Studio has experienced and it's basically just the fact that a model is as far away from a model as you could possibly imagine if you look at a model's description right and even just using common sense it says uh they group objects together right so for parts and everything so you might be saying okay well if I make several parts and I want to make them into a model so we have a part over here and then we have a part over here right look at my beautiful creation okay it's very nice the issue is if I actually play the game they fall right and I don't want that to happen I want all of them to be grouped together because then if they fall they're going to fall all together as one model right so then I can just you know right click group as a model perfect does that fix the problem haha okay but like I'm sure that models probably have like some scripting functionality cuz you know otherwise isn't a model just a glorified folder cuz you know you can put items and folders and you can put items and models so what's the big difference and that's what every beginner thinks right so they you know they put a script inside of the model and then you know they make a variable for the model so local script. parent the only thing that you can do with a model is move it to something which you might say okay that's actually really nice right so we can give it a you know X Y and Z coordinate so let's say 0 10 0 so it's going to move it above the spawn location okay so you might be thinking okay at least it does something right but just give me a second okay because I'm going to show you something right now and then we're going to come back to this move to function and then I'll show you why literally no one likes using it ever so remember how I told you how like oh yeah if I run this game then the models all fall or rather I should say how do we make it so that they still fall but as one individual part because as you can see when I actually hover my mouse over it the outline seems to suggest that this is all one part right so what you have to do is you have to find a part that's supposed to be like the primary part so models have this thing they have a property called primary part so let's say the primary part is going to be the one at the bottom what you then have to do is you have to add in a weld constraint for every other part so there's two parts so we need two weld constraints and then the weld constraint needs a part zero and a part one with part zero being you know the part that they're under like so and then part one being the other parts so for the first weld constraint it's this part for the second weld constraint it's this part and when you do it like this then yeah there we go and it's like okay that works I guess but what's the point of the model then I you know what I could do you know what I could do I could make a folder right now I'll do it right now out of spite out of pure spite wow wow guys would you look at that and remember how I told you how we're going to come back to move two and why it's bad what I'll do is I'll anchor all of these parts that you know they're not like affected by gravity and so what I've just done is I just wrote some code which basically just means that every 1 second we're going to clone this model okay and then we're going to move it to Vector 010 0 right so what you would expect is like okay it's going to clone this model it's going to move it to the you know Vector 0 10 0 and then because the model is anchored it's just going to stay there so then when it makes another model it's going to put that model inside of the previous model and so on and you know what happens move two it doesn't the issue with move two is that it does not allow models to go inside another model which might seem kind of obvious to you like oh yeah what's the problem with that but the issue is like when I give it concise coordinates I want it to be at these exact coordinates right and so what move 2 does is it just says haha no you can't and it just this isn't what position what position is this model at 0580 it's 48 studs off the next thing is the heavy confusion of server versus client and this is something I actually talked about in a couple of my recent videos right the main idea of server versus client is that client is how you perceive the game while the server is basically just a neutral overview of the game so in a real Roblox game the client is basically ran by your device right while the server is ran by actual Roblox servers but the issue here is that sometimes both of these don't show exactly the same information and let me show you what I mean right if I just take this model right now and I just delete it and then I go to with the server the model is still there it's still a thing right but then for me the model stopped existing if you're confused about this do have like a couple other videos you could watch after this one but let me show you why this messes up a lot of games right let's say for example okay for example I just had a script and then let's say that okay every 1 second we're going to you know get the workspace do model um like so and then we're just going to set its name okay to be equal to model obviously this is a stupid change that does nothing but like let's assume that this is a real game and like this is a very important change that we're trying to make and so now that I'm playing this game okay the script is being ran now we don't see anything happening but the fact that we aren't getting any errors means that everything's working fine right now if I go to my client right and then I you know delete this model like so the model doesn't exist anymore but the script isn't giving us any errors right but then if I go on the server we can see like okay the model is still here right and then if I delete the model then it's going to yeah model is not a valid member of workspace now in this example this isn't like really a big problem but I would have so many moments where like I would have a server script and let's say I was looking for the model and then it's like I would play the game and I'd be on my client and I would check the workspace and I would see the model but then the script would tell me like oh yeah but model doesn't exist and I was so confused and it legit took me like an hour of browsing Google to even learn what server was and then I click on the server and then you know it that doesn't have the model and then I'm kind of like okay this kind of makes sense now right but I have seen a bunch of developers being confused about this like bro like it's saying that model isn't a valid member but uh I I can see the the model right here right uh why isn't why is it giving me an error it's because it's on the server so click on the server fix it and yeah another very heartbreaking Discovery is that you have to manually save people's data because you know how Roblox has these like leaderboards on the top right where it like shows how much cash the player has let me actually script that right now so I'll show you exactly what I mean so like if I play the game right now right and I go on the server the way it works is that the player needs to have a folder inside of them called leader stats so exactly called leader stats right and then inside of that folder you add number value right so I can name this like cash and then I could set this to like 100 or whatever right and then what that's going to do is it's going to show you this leaderboard and so what a lot of people do right is they basically just check whenever a player actually you know joins their game so you know they get the player everything and so then what they do is they just make a folder you know put it inside the player and then they make an in value and put that inside of the folder right so then what happens is that when the player joins the game there you go they have their nice leader set value if let's say on the server right they have like a thing where like let's say if I click on this model I get 10 cash for example right so then value goes up to 10 okay there we go now I have 10 value and then if I leave the game okay so I leave the game and then I come back to play the game my value is back at zero I've seen so many questions about this like oh why isn't my value saving am I supposed to publish the game to Roblox and no you don't have to publish your game to Roblox all you have to do is write this script which I will say that I teach this script and B basically everything we're going to cover in this video inside of my course which you can find in the description blah blah blah now these ones were confusing but like they make a lot more sense when I actually talk about them right like okay yeah it makes sense you know why the data doesn't save or you know why the models aren't working somehow but then this next one is legitimately just a waste of time I have no idea why they have this here I I I genuinely have no clue what Roblox was smoking they have two colors actually confused the hell out of me it's like it doesn't seem that important like okay well yeah you have two colors just pick one and it doesn't like seem that important like like maybe you're thinking okay maybe brick color is for the actual like you know brick and then maybe color is for like the material right but it's not if I change the brick color to be like sign or whatever it changes the color if I change the color it then changes the brick color these two are literally coexisting for no real reason and what makes it worse is that the brick color is literally just a worse version of color because how it works right is that it has this you know little color spectrum and every color has its own unique name so so inside of a script I could say like okay parts. brick color equals seashell or I could say parts. brick color equals Mulberry right so basically if I'm using a brick color I am limited to using these colors only but then if I'm using Color I literally get the entire color wheel and the only difference here is that instead of having a fun name like toothpaste it just uses RGB values what a lot of beginners find confusing is scripting in general which I know kind of makes sense right but then you have stuff like co- routine I specifically remember watching like a beginner Roblox tutorial like 3 years ago right and this guy literally 20 minutes in just says like hey hey guys by the way uh we're going to use a co- routine but I'm not going to explain so you know just just so I literally just copied and pasted his code and then my code just ended up being full of co- routines and I had no idea what these do co- routine. yield or co- routine is yieldable because for the most part scripts are fairly simple like okay you know you have local variables and you you can assign them to numbers and then you know you have loops and then if if you want to change the property of something well then you know you say workspace and then you get that you know thing but here it's like what's an enum bro en. humanoid display distance type what does this mean and there's a lot more stuff right we got um you know PE calls uh we got XP call which you know I don't even know what that is we also have secret which at this point I just think Roblox is trolling us like this this cannot be a real thing and if scripts weren't confusing enough the next thing which is stupid which is also purple just like this model is something called a module script unlike a regular script this script does nothing okay basically it just has like a table and then it just returns a table and then the idea is that you can like put functions and variables inside of this table and then from any script you can basically get this table and then you know use the variables and functions inside of this table but where did they get confusing for developers is it's like I said before a lot of beginners they want to understand why something is done because when you're confused by something it's just because you don't know what that thing does you don't know the purpose behind that thing and it's the same with module scripts you might be asking right now like oh yeah why do I need a module script like why do I need to have a table here where I could just make a table here you could literally take this code right you can just copy it over here and you can just do the same thing just instead of returning the module you just have it in your script right so you can just say like oh yeah module. new function is equal to you know function and then you make your function and then this this is what people do in module script right so so instead of doing this here and then having to you know call like um require on it which is how you get the table why couldn't you just do all of this inside the actual script now the answer is that like yeah like these things are valuable because it's just one table that can be full of like a bunch of functions cuz let's say for example you have like um a game based around abilities right and let's say you have like five of these scripts that need to actually access a table of like functions that perform these abilities and you could just copy the table in inside all of the five scripts or you can just have this table be inside of this module script and then whenever you actually need to access the table you can just say like local module is equal to require and then you get the module so in this case it's inside of our script so we'll just say script. module script and then yeah from there you can just have module and then you can just access whatever is inside the table the second to last confusion is this idea of player versus character to sum it up this is your character okay this is your actual physical presence in the game but then the thing is what if I respawn okay what if I what if I reset my character right well then for a split second my character stops existing right like he he kind of still exists but there's like a split second where my character gets deleted and so obviously in that little moment where my character is deleted Roblox still needs to know that I'm actually playing the game so the way Roblox handles this is that your character is inside of the workspace so it's a model right it has like you know your all of your accessories your humanoid it has all of these you know parts so I can delete my head and then that kills me right so that probably wasn't a good idea but then if you want to get the actual player well then you go to players right and then this is my player which contains all of the actual like data right so it has my you know player user interface it contains my player scripts it has like the backpack which is like your inventory and then the player itself contains stuff like what the character is right uh the character appearance ID the display name I'm just saying right because if you ever want to like teleport you know the player's character somewhere the way you do this is you just change the position of their humanoid Roots part right but then like I would tell this to people and then you know what they do they would like send me a script of like oh am I doing this right and the script was like game. players. the original lamp. humanoid root part. position and then the script would tell them like oh uh the player doesn't have a humanoid root part and then they would send me a screenshot and then they would be like uh it's saying that there's no humanoid root part but it's like in my game they clearly have a humanoid root part and I'm like bro you're accessing the player not the character and the last but definitely not least confusion is user interface okay this thing has literally stolen The Souls of so many developers I can't even start counting you know you got buttons you got labels and everything right and then you have a viewport frame I'm not even about to start explaining what this thing does you have a video frame okay and if that wasn't bad enough if you just want a button right okay you can move it around you know very nice and then let's say you want to change the size right X and Y scale and offset what the hell is scale what the hell is offset right oh what is this oh when when I lower the screen the button isn't scaling along with the screen how do I fix that well I need to change the scale oh but then what what is offset what is scale and the scariest part is that that's actually like the easiest thing to learn about GUI eventually you're going to start working with like UI page layout that's when you're going to start to like appreciate user interface in games a lot more but hopefully this video convinced you to start Roblox development if this video unironically made you want to start developing Roblox Studio the first few lessons of my course are actually free to watch so if you want to get like an actual highquality and modern guide to Roblox studio and not like a stupid beginner tutorial where some guy's talking to about like oh co- routines haha co- routines then click on the top Link in the description or maybe not top link I don't know it's going to be one of the links and yeah you know if you want to reward me for my 3 years of suffering with this terrible application I do quite like the idea of having a silver play button so if this video helped

UE_4mNwcXco	I Tried Learning Roblox Scripting	DeHapy	147438	16:44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE_4mNwcXco	roblox scripting tutorial	This is Billy. And with one simple line of code, I have the ability to set Billy into a glorious fireball of pain and endless suffering. But don't worry, the fire shouldn't actually hurt. Burning Billy is just one of the many things that we'll be coding in today's video because I'm trying to become a procriptor in the next 7 days, and that's a pretty difficult task. But a few days ago, I sent a message to my friend asking if he would be down to coach me, and he said yes. >> What should I even teach you? I don't even know. >> Meet Sub Doggy. What's up, guys? He's one of my friends who's been coding for over four years. And you may recognize him from his own channel where he's made several successful games and got my friend completely hooked on Pogo Sim. >> I can do like the one that I started with, which was a sword fighting game. That was like the first one I made. >> Yeah. After deciding what kind of game we'd be making, I went straight to making the lobby instead of scripting. We got the lobby, we got the spawns, now we need the round system. So, you should add a script in server script service. Okay. Now what we can do in here is create the round system. We just go like while true do and then you got to repeat past that wait until boom. So now this will wait 15 seconds. >> All right. So can you explain what you just did or what? >> Actually let's get the let's make this look better and then we can teleport all the players back. >> Were you following along well there? >> I I think I was. Yeah. >> Now that we finished scripting the round system, it's time to see if what we made actually works. >> Oh my gosh, I have a sword. Oh, I'm going to kill you. Wait, what? >> I won. Let's go. >> Oh, no. Let's go. >> So, in case you couldn't tell, I didn't learn a single thing from that 2hour call. Instead of teaching me how to code, he just spent half the time showing me his unreleased FPS game. And somehow that led to us playing Arsenal. Got you. I killed you. >> I'm thinking we might need to try something different tomorrow. Come on. YES. I can't do this. That looked like a pretty tough fall. Looks like somebody's been trying to learn how to code. How did you find me here? Don't worry, man. This is exactly why I teach people step by step. >> Wait, are you saying you could teach me how to code? >> Oh, of course. I have an online class designed for all ages. By the end, you'll actually have the ability to make a full game on your own. Right when I needed him most, Seal came in clutch and sent me over this beginnerfriendly scripting course that teaches everything you need to know in order to make a Roblox game. Maybe with this course, we actually have a shot at learning how to code. If you want one of these courses for yourself, just go to definitely not seal.com and be sure to use code dehabi when checking out. Now, let's go ahead and open this course. When opening the course, I noticed that each section has a load of lecture videos and ends with a workshop where Seal gives a small coding challenge to complete. So, over the next few days, I'm going to dive into those workshops, test what I learned, and start piecing things together. >> >> All right. So, we just reached the end of the first section. So, it's time to see what our first challenge is. >> So, the goal of this assignment is to make a part that starts to crawl a certain direction based on its size. I'm going to hit run here. And as we can see, this part is moving based on its size. See, now that I've adjusted the size, it scoots 10 studs forward. And it's set to do that multiple times before it ends. See if you can make it. And afterwards, we'll go through and make it together. All right. So, this is the part where we test everything I've learned up to this point. And there's no pressure. It's not like hundreds of thousands of people are going to judge me if I fail. Anyways, I got started by adding a part in the workspace and creating a script in server script service, which is where we're going to be able to code the entire system for this first workshop. And now the system is complete, I think. So, when we press the play button at the top, we should see this part moving every second. And if you look really close, you can see that the part isn't moving at all. If we go ahead and take a look in the output, you can see that there is actually an error, and it seems to be going on in this line. So, I ended up redoing the whole thing, and I found a simpler approach, which actually ended up working really well. But, we still have to test the second half of this project, which is making the part change based on its size. So, as you saw there, I changed the X value, and now it's moving a lot further each tick. And now we have successfully completed our first workshop, which means it's time to move on to workshop number two. >> So with our workshop, we're going to be using our button asset and our lamp asset. When we click this button, our lamp turns on. See if you can write this yourself. >> Wait, that's it? This seems simple enough. The first thing I did was set our project to nighttime. Then I created the simple model for the button with a green part on top. And I set the material to neon so that it glows a bit in this dark map. I ended up doing the same thing for this lamp. Then I turned the transparency down so that it doesn't look like the light is on yet. But we still need the lamp to actually light up the surroundings. So I added a point light. Now we are officially done with creating the models, which means we can finally get to scripting. For the script, I made a simple system that connects a function every time the button is clicked. Within this function, the button turns darker, the lamp gets brighter, and the point light gets enabled. But we still have to see if this actually works by testing the game and clicking on the button. >> >> Welcome to our workshop. The test that I have for you today is a bit of a challenging one. So, I've got two wooden logs here. Wood A, wood B. When you click wood A, it prints wood A's value. If you click wood B, you get wood B's value, which is $25. Let's pause the video here and go ahead and give that a shot. To start off this workshop, I made my own wood A and B models. And within each of these models, I added a touch part with a click detector, which tracks when the player clicks on the part. Now, we just need to add a script and server script service, and we can get straight to creating a simple system to print the values of each wood type in the output. Maybe I should actually explain what my code does. So, here's how all of that looks together. And I hope that made a little bit of sense. So, just like the other workshops, I had to make sure our system actually worked. And from the looks of it, everything seemed to actually work on the first try, which I was not expecting. I ended off the day by completing the final module in our course, and the workshop was actually really boring, so I'm not even going to bother showing it. But, we did complete the full beginner's course. So, now it's time to go off on our own and see what we've actually learned from this. Over the last few days, Seal's course has allowed us to learn more about Roblox scripting than I could have ever imagined. But before we continue on with this challenge, I need to come clean about something. It's been 4 months since my last video. Oops. But don't worry, because I have not been up to nothing. In fact, I've hired a team who's been hard at work helping me bring my dream game to life called Pet Islands. It's been over a year since we started development on this game, and I'm really excited to announce that it's almost ready to be released. So, if you're as excited as I am, be sure to join both the Discord server and Roblox group, which are linked down in the description. And now that you've done that, we can get back to coding our own game. Let's go. For the last week, we've had Definitely Nile right by our side, showing us how everything works. But now, we are completely on our own. Like no one's going to save us if we mess this up. No pressure. Assuming you've watched my previous videos, you'd know I like to challenge myself with small projects that get progressively harder. And what better way to start than by setting something on fire. Let's get started by adding a part in the workspace and adding a proximity prompt so we can interact with it when we're close. And now when we interact with the part, it should change color. In Seal's course, we learned about click detectors, but not proximity prompts. And I can't afford to buy the more advanced course because my wallet's still recovering from buying Moon Animator in the last video, which means we have no choice other than to do things the old-fashioned way. This is the Roblox dev form, a magical place where all of your problems disappear. That's a lie. I just spent 20 minutes getting even more confused about what proximity prompts are. So, we're just going to go with a click detector because that's what I know how to do. After getting the click detector working, I used my incredible VFX skills from a few videos ago to make this amazing fire particle. That's right, I didn't even use the toolbox. After pulling the fire particle from the toolbox, I just had to modify the code to spawn the fire on the part when it's clicked. Why is it not even on the part? What? With the power of editing, the code now magically works. But there is one issue with this code, which is that I can keep clicking the part over and over again, and the fire just keeps getting brighter. What? You thought I was going to fix it. After creating a supernova, I decided to calm down and make a part that just moves back and forth. Since I only bought the beginner's version of Seal's course, I never actually learned how to make a part move. So, I went back over to the dev form, stole some random tween service code that made zero sense to me, and it seems to be working just fine with no issues at all. Turns out I just had to anchor the part so it doesn't randomly fly away. And believe it or not, that took me 30 minutes to figure out. At least it's done now, which means we can move on to the next project, which is a coin collecting system. Before we can make the system to collect coins, we should probably make a way to track how much money the player has, which means I have to add leader stats to my game, which is this little stats thing in the corner you see in most Roblox games. And now with the leader stats in place, I got straight to creating the coin collecting system. And I thought it was going to be simple. You know, the player just touches the coin, it gets deleted, and you get money. But no, instead of deleting the coin, it just spits out a bunch of errors. After figuring out the system for one coin, I made a separate system that works multiple coins at once. I even added this fancy text to show just how filthy rich we are after collecting each coin. >> One eternity later. >> I think I accidentally recreated all of the 2018 speed simulators where some coins are different colors and give you more points. And these points increase your run speed. So, I guess they used to be popular because it takes like zero effort to make. Now that we've accidentally made a speed simulator, it's time to move on to our next project, which is a mining simulator. I figured that one of the essential parts of this is going to be the pickaxe system. So, I imported a pickaxe model from a few years ago and made it a tool that the player can hold. But, we didn't have anything to break yet. So, I added in a few parts that will break when testing, and I put them in a folder named rocks. The reason I put them in this folder is so that the player can't accidentally break the entire map and get stuck in the void. When testing, I ran into this small issue where the rock disappears before the pickaxe even reaches it. Huh? >> So, I added a small delay between when the animation starts and when the rock actually gets destroyed. I felt like I was on fire with this project. It was coming together so quick, but we're still missing a crucial part of the game. In other mining simulators, you start off by mining boring gray rocks like the ones we have right now. But as you progress through the game, you start to find emeralds, rubies, and glowing rainbow blocks worth millions of dollars. This variety helps keep the players online for longer, which ultimately makes the game developers more money, which is exactly why I added it into our game. >> HELLO, I LIKE MONEY. >> After adding a replace part function that picks a random rock and adding an int value into each rock to show how much it's worth, the player's total money now increases based on the rock's value whenever it gets destroyed. And to top everything off, I brought in these beautiful rock models because I was getting sick of the big blocks. And I added this inventory system that shows what ores the player has in a backpack before selling them. But then came the difficult part, selling the ores. I made countless attempts to get this working. I thought maybe it was just a small fix, but everything I did just made it worse. And at this point, I didn't really know what to do. I realized the shop wasn't working because I had all of the stats changing on the client side. instead of the server side. And Seal literally explained this to me in one of his lessons. So now I knew exactly what the issue was. But honestly, I did not have any mental energy left to go through and do all the work of fixing it. So to take a little mental break, I decided to go over to the Discord server and ask you guys for some ideas. Let's see what dumb ideas we have this video. >> Make a game where each click is one stud you can move. Who the would play this? Welcome to my super interactive game where you click a button on the top of your screen and it allows you to run 10 studs. Oh, you run out of studs. Just click the button more and you can keep walking. There's got to be a better idea somewhere in here. Script a hotel bell that explodes if you click it enough. How do you guys even come up with this stuff? All right. Well, I guess we need to start with a bell. And we can't have a bell without sounds. This is perfect. Let's see if it works now. >> >> Why don't you try making an FPS system or you can't do that? >> Wow, I really wasn't expecting to be able to make an FPS this quick. Call me Einstein. >> So, now that my ego is boosted by making those super small projects, it's time to go and make the tycoon. And for this, I decided to go over to YouTube and follow a tutorial >> to create a tycoon on Roblox in 2024. >> I don't know why I thought this would be good content. I just followed exactly what the tutorial said. I set up the plots. I made it so that plots get assigned to players. I made a button that spawns in this rock. I messed around and got stuck in a pile of rocks. I made this cool dropper. Gave it a conveyor. And yeah, that's basically 3 hours summed up in 10 seconds. After finishing the YouTube tutorial, I decided to try and customize it to make a grow a garden tycoon. So, I made a system that has this flower model grow over time, and once it's fully grown, it gets deleted and it drops apart onto the conveyor belt. But, I'm going to be honest, I wasn't really having much fun making a tycoon because I just copied a tutorial and I didn't even learn anything from it. That was such a waste of time. And I know that I said the tycoon would be the final project, but I think I'm actually going to go back to the mining simulator since we left it half complete. After about an hour of off camera work, I finally got the system working the way that I wanted. But when you sell the ores, the inventory UI doesn't exactly update. So, while I just made money, the stone is still in the UI. To fix this, I created a function called clear inventory UI. And the purpose of this function is to clear the inventory UI. Call me Einstein. After getting the clear inventory UI working, I went ahead and added two additional ores to the game, which are going to be iron and diamond. And to add their icons into the inventory, I did my usual process of dragging it into photo peak and adding a black stroke to each image. So now, for example, if we break a diamond ore, it shows up as diamond in our inventory. So now we've completed all of the systems that I would consider necessary for a complete mining simulator. But we still need a map. So, I went over to shopdehappy.com, got this premium nature asset pack, and dragged it straight into my project. Wait, you don't know what Shopyappy is? All right, so this is Billy. Okay, Billy saw this video and decided that he wanted to make his own Roblox game. But when he opened Roblox Studio, he realized, "Oopsy dupsy, mama poopsy. I don't know what the I'm doing." If this sounds like you, you are in luck. Shopy Happy has loads of files that you can simply drag into Roblox Studio and you have a full game. I used the premium asset pack from Shop to Happy and it completely transformed my game. Just look at the results. And if you still don't believe me, meet Darden. He started with one of our packs for just $38 and it led him to make over 10 million Robux. So, if you're interested in capitalizing on this opportunity for yourself, be sure to use code code for 20% off. That's right, the code is code. Let's just get back to work. When building the map, I took the most basic approach possible, which is spamming border parts around the map, adding some decorations around the cell, and filling up every open gap with a bunch of random nature. And just like that, we have something that some people might consider a complete game. But I'm still really happy with how this game turned out because it showed that I'm able to make something complete, even if the bell is my favorite.	17991	t	The content addresses the common struggle of beginner Roblox developers through a narrative '7-day challenge' format, highlighting specific technical concepts like round systems and part manipulation.	{"Roblox scripting for beginners","Roblox round system script","learn Roblox Luau","Roblox Studio tutorial",ServerScriptService,"Roblox part movement script"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	[{"apis": ["Instance.new", "Fire"], "problem": "Create a script that instantiates a fire effect inside a specific part", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["task.wait", "ServerScriptService"], "problem": "Implement a repeating round system loop with a countdown timer", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "intermediate", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["Players:GetPlayers", "HumanoidRootPart", "CFrame"], "problem": "Teleport all players in a server to a specific location (Lobby)", "category": "Networking", "difficulty": "intermediate", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["BasePart.Position", "BasePart.Size", "Vector3"], "problem": "Program a part to move (crawl) a distance relative to its own size", "category": "Physics", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["ClickDetector", "PointLight", "BasePart.Material"], "problem": "Create a button-activated light system", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}]	Roblox Scripting Fundamentals and Game Loop Logic	f	\N	\N
wjwz2mlC7qc	5 MISTAKES Beginner Roblox SCRIPTERS make...	Gamer M8	98638	2:54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjwz2mlC7qc	roblox scripting tutorial	here are five mistakes developers make by learning the script and how to avoid doing them tip number one learn the basics a lot of people find scripting too hard so instead they rely on using three models and specific tutorials rather than learning how to script themselves but learning the basics first will make it a lot easier that way you'll start to understand what each line does and then eventually be able to write your own scripts and there's loads of videos on YouTube that'll show you everything you need to know when it comes to scripting for beginners there's also for Dev Forum where other developers go to ask questions and help each other out and then there's Roblox documentation which is a website and explains a lot about scripting and Roblox studio in general tip number two organize your scripts you can do this by adding in comments which I use to leave notes and explanations they're also really helpful when you're a beginner because you can leave notes next to each line of code reminding you what it does and how it works having a good format also makes it a lot easier to read your script and you can do this by heading over to a script Tab and selecting format document and finally keep all of your names short and understandable whether it's a variable a function or whatever else otherwise it can get really confusing tip number three errors there's going to be times where a script doesn't work and you don't know how to fix it so here's what you should do read the script again to make sure there's no mistakes because sometimes things will be underlined in red to show that there's a mistake on that line next check the output window to see if there's any errors showing up and you can access it by going to a view Tab and then clicking on output but sometimes nothing appears in the output window so instead you have to debug it you can do this using a print function under sections of your code and if it prints in the output then that part of the script is working but if it doesn't appear then that part of the script is broken it's also a good idea to search for dead Forum to see if anyone else has had the same problem and fixed it but if nothing comes up you might have to leave your own posts on for their Forum or any Roblox Studio Discord servers for help tip number four try out different methods just because your script might work doesn't mean it's the most efficient way of doing it for example you can use one remote event instead of multiple and still get the same result or another example you you can use functions instead of repeating your code multiple times and it might be a bit confusing to know which way you should do it but if you keep learning and practicing then you should eventually be able to understand what might be the best way of doing something tip number five don't give up this one might sound obvious but going back to what I said in tip number one a lot of people say scripting is too hard and that they don't understand what any of it means or they forget everything they've learned I let people quit because of it but of course you're going to say stuff like that when you're a beginner learning to script can take a lot of time and practice so keep on trying and don't give up and that's going to be it if you want to

_lStViGR1x4	Explaining ModuleScripts As If You Were 5	ByteBlox	98316	9:01	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lStViGR1x4	roblox scripting tutorial	all right so if you're like me which I assume you are because you know the thumbnail and the title of the video caught your attention enough for you to actually click and continue listening to me blabber on about the video um You probably have wondered okay what the hell is a module script right I've been developing for the past I would say two years okay and literally I only started using these like a month ago and even then I don't really use them that much right um so you probably know what a script is yeah it's a server script you know you know what a local script is yeah it's a it's it's a script for you know clients for players what is this though what does this do so this is this is what Roblox defines as a a script fragment which only runs when another script uses require on it so if I click on the module script if I add one right now as you can see it says local module is a table and it returns a module so think of a module script as a table because that's all that's all it is module script is literally just a table which will contain functions and variables right now you know you can add functions and variables to it so what I'm going to do is I'm going to place a script inside the server script service like so and I'll just place the module script inside of of the script right why not you don't like you don't have to do this I'm just doing it just to keep stuff organized right so like I said a module script is effectively just a table and I can put anything I want inside this table one two three hello nil right so a table is just something that can hold multiple values and the way you can get like this table of a module script inside other script is you say so you make a variable for the table you say local I don't know module table something like that and then you say require and then you get the module script so in our case it's it's just going to be script. module script right but then if your script was inside replicated storage you would say game. replicated storage. module script right so now this module table if I print it out if I print out module table and I play the game right now as you can see we're printing out the module table which is going to be 1 2 3 hello and then it's not going to have a third value because remember the third value was nil or nothing what's the point why make a whole other script when I can just have this right when I can just put take the table clone it over whatever because they're not meant to be used like this what a module script is is what okay what module scripts are used for is adding functions and variables inside of this table if I right now say module dot new function is equal to function this will now create a function yeah like so so module do new function equals function 1 2 3 so now this module table is going to have a function inside of it called the new function which is going to do this right and so if I run the game you know and it's going to print out the module table it prints out new fun function which is a function right and inside the script If instead of printing the table I say something like modu table. new function it's going to go to the module table right so it so it has the table and the table right now has a function in it called a new function and then once we require the module script once we have that table in in like you know another script from there we can access all of you know whatever inside the module table be it functions variables so on so if I run the right now if I run this new function it's going to print out one 2 three there we go um and so it's worth noting that it it does it on the module script as well so it doesn't do it from the like the server it does it from the module script however you you need to call it from the server because module scripts they're not going to run by themselves right like you need you need a server script or a local script to require a module script and then like run anything there right um so you can have functions or you can can have uh module do new VAR which is just could just be a variable right hello hello like so so if I right now were to say okay okay print modu table. Newar so if I were to play the game as you can see it runs the function and then here it prints hello on the on the on the script this time not the module script right so that's that's kind of the idea behind module scripts right it's it's literally just a table right where you can put in functions and you can put in variables now here's what's worth kind of explaining because for me I I I I was I was still struggling to get module scripts I was like oh like this is kind of confusing like why do I do module dot what's the point of like why do I have to do this right in Roblox when you create a table so I'm actually going to do this right I'm going to just going to delete this right I'm going to delete the module script in fact there we go it's gone I'm going to make a new table just call it new table and make it equal to this right in order to add stuff to tables what people do is they they say the table name then they do Dot and then they put in the name of something they either want to add or change right so if I say new table do um Newar right so right now the table is empty but I say new table. Newar is equal to 23 and then I print out the new table so right now empty right and but then by by doing this I'm going to add in um a new VAR item which is equal to one 23 so then if I print that then as you can see yeah it says Newar is equal to 1 two3 right um or what I could also do is I could just say something like you know new VAR equal to 1 2 3 so that's effectively the same thing so you can you could either write the table like this uh but then like I I do not recommend it because obviously the easier way is just to say um yeah now it's recommending it to me because it knows that there's a new VAR value in the table and now I could set it to be something different I could say it set it to be 3 to1 and now this will not this won't create a new Newar value it will just override the one we have already so we're still going to have one new Newar value but instead of 1 2 3 it's going to be equal to 321 what the module scripts are used for module scripts when you require them they just give you like the table right so what I could do here is I could literally just like have a table and I can add my own function functions to it right I can say okay new table do new function is equal to function and then I can have it print hello that is going to work well it's not going to run the function because we haven't actually ran it yet but yeah as you can see I I technically don't need module scripts I could do everything still from here so I have a table I give it a function and then here I could run the function I could say new table do new function just like so and then this is going to run the function and print hello that's that's pretty cool now why people use module script is basically just for organization right because again the module script is the same thing you know it make it makes a table and then it returns that table when a script requires a module script the reason you would use a much of script is because you you you sometimes want a table that has like a lot of functions you know or and like a lot of variables inside of it so what you could either do anytime a script needs all of those like functions you're going to have inside of this table sure like you could do this where you just you know make a new table for every script and you add all of the functions all over again you know for every single script that needs them or you could just have all of them in one spot in one module script and then whenever you need it instead of having to do all of this you just say just just you know local module table is equal to require script. module script there we go so now this module table is going to be equal to you know this table which obviously right now is empty but the beauty of the module script is that any single script as long as it has access to it is allowed to require and use all of the functions and variables that are inside of the module script right so that that's effectively all there is right so if you have any questions leave a comment if I got something wrong leave a comment if neither of those things happened still leave a comments um check out my the comments I I'm going to have a link to an amazing newsletter that you can sign up to where I'm going to give you helpful advice and every now and then I'm going to sell you my product my $7,000 course of course so you know make sure to sign up you know and look out for that and yeah I've deleted everything and we're back to basics thank you for watching	8781	t	This content addresses a major hurdle for beginner Roblox developers by simplifying ModuleScripts into the familiar concept of tables, providing clear instructions on using the require() function and code organization.	{"Roblox ModuleScript tutorial","Roblox scripting for beginners","Lua require function","Roblox ModuleScript vs Script","Luau table functions","Roblox game development"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	[{"apis": ["require", "ModuleScript"], "problem": "Accessing and executing code from a ModuleScript in another script using require", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["ModuleScript"], "problem": "Defining and exporting functions within a ModuleScript table", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["ModuleScript"], "problem": "Sharing global variables across multiple scripts using a ModuleScript", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["game.ReplicatedStorage", "require"], "problem": "Referencing ModuleScripts located in different service containers like ReplicatedStorage", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["ModuleScript"], "problem": "Storing multiple data types including nil and strings within a ModuleScript table", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}]	Introduction to ModuleScripts for code organization and cross-script functionality	f	\N	\N
hYmCubhiRVw	3 Tips To Learn Roblox Scripting FAST!	SmartyRBX	93280	6:31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYmCubhiRVw	roblox scripting tutorial	ever felt like scripting is just so annoying and it's slowing you down today I'm going to drop three amazing tips that have made me script faster than ever before so get ready for a complete paradigm shift in the way that you script that you won't hear anywhere else listen everyone talks about how hard that scripting is and how long it's going to take to learn and all these things right but what if I told you all of this is just the way you see it it's all in your head and and if you simply change the way that you think and you do a few small tweaks you are going to have a huge difference in the way that you script and I'm going to debunk some myths in this video and actually give you actionable steps to speed up game development so the first tip well the fundamentals don't change so the first step is to know the fundamentals the basics and from there you can really write any script cover the basics and you can literally learn anything else in scripting from there there's a saying that knowledge weighs nothing it's not as difficult as you think and I have a full scripting guide you can open that top right hand corner you can pop that open in a new tab and you can go ahead and learn scripting like really fast there's nothing stopping you and the basics are all you need to start expanding tip two think in systems not in line so most people they get stuck scripting because they're scripting line by line but no you need to think in system in Frameworks if you're thinking line by line you're basically coding in isolation every time you face a new problem you're starting from zero basically and it's kind of like if you were like a firefighter running from each emergency to another and it's just it's just not sustainable to code this way you're constantly reactive you're reacting the thing rather than proactive which means that you are ready and you're taking action now and you're causing things to move to happen so here is the gamechanging advice see your code AS interconnected systems instead of individual lines or functions think about how each thing in your script interacts and what you're doing by thinking this way is you're actually raising your mindset you're no longer digging through seas and oceans of lines of code you are controlling it from above you're looking at it from a bird's eye view you see all of the outcomes all the potential and everything in your script as a whole rather than individual problems where you get stuck in the details so how do you start thinking like this though well you need to build Frameworks not just oneoff scripts you can start writing your scripts with more functions that's a good start you can start making things more modular that way and you can also use module scripts and what is a module script well that's a good question a module script is a script that lets you store functions unless you store other things too and you can reference the functions in these scripts from other scripts making your game well more modular and when you think in modules in reusable components and scalable solutions to problems when you think this way you can write code that doesn't just serve one game or one part of a game but multiple games and multiple components of those games you're not just solving one problem you're solving a whole bunch of issues that might come up in the future it's planning ahead at its finest and not just planning ahead planning overhead right so start thinking in systems not not in individual pieces of code like when I started thinking this way I cut down my scripting time a ton like before I was making a whole bunch of random scripts for each little thing trying to put like a script in each tiny little kill brick for my Obby right and it's so tedious to be thinking on individual scripts individual lines right you got to think in systems and when I started thinking in systems literally it changed everything back back then I'd be making each each kill brick scripted one by one but then I made one script and it was a system and it scripted any any kill Breck that came into a folder for example would instantly be a kill brick and when you have a system when you have a flexible system it can now be adapted for anything else you want to add to your game later so this is like a huge tip I know I've gone on on the second point for so long but this will speed you up incredibly this is the most important change and also if you want a book that will help you think in systems there's actually this book called well thinking in systems and I haven't finished it but it's really helped me like see my channel better see a lot of things better and you can see things and systems when you read this book a lot better and it's really just helpful for coding and a lot of things too all right tip three leverage pre-existing code modules libraries tools anything you can get your hands on right so there's tons and tons of tools and libraries and module scripts and open source projects and even some free models that can really speed up your scripting and there's so many things that other developers have made which you can use and even learn from I'm not saying to just copy stuff I'm saying you can you can use different things you can look at the way it was scripted to learn a lot and we're going to look at how you can actually start to find modules and start to find things that people have made that can speed up the way that you script so you can find these on the dev Forum the Roblox Dev Forum there's this section called I believe it's called Community Resources and in this section there are thousands of resources that Roblox developers have made that you can reuse in your game and a lot of this is like code Etc right and when you have this you can literally insert a module in your game you can use some of the functions and code that they they've made already and you can speed up the way that you code so much it's it's unbelievable now there you have it those are three amazing tips to speed up the way that you script and now it is on you to apply this it's one thing to you know know the path you need to take and it's a completely different thing to actually walk down that path so get moving subscribe and we'll also want to click the video on screen if you want to learn a process to practice scripting and ensure that you actually can remember the concepts right and you can also click the other link to the right uh to join scripting Secrets which is like a master class on scripting and the lessons I've made making viral Roblox games with up to 20 million plus visits it is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see you

LWL5QUdSQiA	All Of Roblox Lua (Luau) in 21 Minutes	KatanaBladeHD	70880	20:48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWL5QUdSQiA	roblox lua tutorial beginner	This is Lua, a highle programming language that was founded in Brazil back in the 1990s. It's designed to be fast, simple, and easy to embed into other programs, which is why it's often used in games, apps, and software extensions. Lua actually means moon in Portuguese, and its syntax is clean and beginnerfriendly, making it a great first programming language to learn. Now, the version of Lua we'll actually be using is called Lu. This is Roblox's own version of the language. Lu started as Lua 5.1 but has been upgraded with extra features such as better performance, type checking, and more built-in functions which are super useful for game development. So if you've used Lua before, Lu look almost completely identical. So the same concepts should still apply. We'll begin learning this language by declaring variables. We can declare a variable by writing local the name of the variable and then making it equal to whatever value you want to associate with it. This is called a local variable. If you don't use the word local, it would be a global variable. Generally, you never want to use a global variable for reasons I'm going to explain at the very end of this video. Just know if you ever want to declare a variable, always use the syntax local to declare it. There are eight basic data types: number, string, nil, boolean, table, and function. The last two data types are called threads and user data. These two are a bit more complicated, so I'm going to explain them towards the end of this video. Numbers. Numbers can represent whole numbers as well as floats. With number variables, you can perform basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We can showcase these numbers in the output log by using a print statement. More advanced functions include for division, modulus, exponentiation, and double negation, which are all native to lure arithmetic. You can also write comments like this with a double dash sign, which have a unique gray syntax color on default, which is why this doesn't print anything as it's ignored by the compiler. It's useful for keeping notes and seeing organized strings. Strings represent a set of characters which you can declare by putting them in quotation marks. Anything on quotation marks are considered strings including numbers and special characters. You can combine strings together like this of a double period. This is called concatenation. There's also string slicing which you can do by writing string sub our string variable our start number and the end number. This way you can print out a portion of the string. Nil nil represents the absence of a value. Since no value is assigned to this variable, this value is automatically initialized as nil. You can also manually assign nil like this too. Boolean. Boolean represents true or false values. They can be declared like this and the word true or false will be highlighted. You can also declare boolean like this too. Is five greater than three? Yes, it is. So when you try to print this, it will come out as true. If a condition wasn't true, it would have printed out false like this. You can also check if two values are equal to each other with a double equal sign. Is 7 equal to 7? Yes, it is. So this will be true. You can also use greater than or equal symbols together. It's important to note that these relational operators can only compare numbers and strings. You can also check if something is not equal to another value like this. Is seven not equal to 8? Yes. So that's true. This comparison works for almost every data type. However, for tables, functions, threads, and user data. It compares our references in memory rather than their actual values. So you need to get a bit more creative when comparing them. You can also reciprocate building values by using a notgate with A being the input and Q being the output. If you print not true, it'll print as false. If you print not false, it'll print as true. Conditionals like these are typically used in if statements. If statements are block of code that only run when the condition inside of it is true. For example, if 9 is greater than 7, it'll print this. If that condition wasn't true, then this block of code would be ignored. Another example is if 1 is greater than two. This is obviously not true. You can see our program completely ignores this print statement. You can use an else statement to run a separate block of code which run only when all previous conditions are false. There's also else if similar to else. Else if blocks of code only run if the previous condition is false and the condition inside of it is true. You can have as many else if statements as you want. We can only have one else statement. Another logic gate you can use is the and operator. This operator checks for two conditions at the same time. It only be true if both conditions are true. For example, this block of code will only run if both of these statements are true, which they are. There's also an or operator which similarly check for two conditions. This will only run if this is true or this value is true or it will also run if both of them are true. It won't run if both of them are false. Functions. Functions are blocks of reusable code that can be run by calling them. We can declare a function by writing a local function and then a name for a function followed by two brackets and an end statement. You can also have a local variable equal to a function. They both do the same thing. You'll notice that nothing prints out here. This is because our program is compiled line by line. And when it sees the function, it skips past it. Only when we call our function like this will our program backtrack and then run the code inside that function. Functions are useful because you can pass in one, two, or more values as arguments. A function will receive these as parameters. Parameters like variables. And similarly, you can name them whatever you want and they'll be equal to whatever you pass in here. You can add these two values here since they're numbers. If you want the sum of these two numbers as a variable, you can return it like this. This is useful because whatever we return will be equal to the call of the function which we can set as a variable and print it. If this statement has no arguments, value 1 and two will be initialized as nil and we get an error on this line. Only because addition only works on numbers and not nil values. So let's remove that for a second. Something important to note is that when our program sees the return line, it will immediately exit the function from that line. So if we tried adding this print statement here, we'd get an error here because it's beyond the scope of the function. But why would this be useful? Take this example here. If we were to call this function, since the player has 15 coins, which is not less than 10, it will ignore that block of code and run the rest of the function. It will print this and take 10 coins away from the player. Suppose the player had eight coins to begin with. Since 8 is less than 10, the statement is true. So it print and return back to the call, skipping the rest of a function. What if you wanted to return two values instead of one? Well, it's important to note you can declare two variables of one line like this. It'll take value one and value two, making them equal to 10 and 15 and separating them with commas. You can see we made two variables of one line here. A similar concept works when you try returning variable 1 and variable 2 and separating them with commas. And if you try printing this call of the function, you'll see you'll get both numbers together. We can separate them by having two variables equal to the call of the function. And the variables are assigned in the order of a return. and how we can print them individually. Tables, arguably the most powerful data type. Tables are used to store multiple data types such as numbers, strings, functions, and even tables themselves. If we were to print a table, it would look like this. If you wanted to print the first item in our table, we can index our table with square brackets and passing a number which represents the position our value is in. If we were to index it of one, we get the first item. If we index it of two, we get the second item, etc. But if we try to index a third item, we get nil. Our program automatically initializes out ofbound indexes as nil. This is useful because if we wanted to add another item to our table, we can index a third item and give it a value. When we print our table, we can see our value has been added to it. You can use this to overwrite different values as well. Another way to add an item to our table is using table.insert. Table.insert is a built-in method that allows you to add an item to the next available index, which is useful if we don't know how many items are in our table. First parameter is our table and our next parameter is the value we want to add. As you can see, this number has been added to our table. Similarly, if you want to remove an item from the table, we can index individual items and make them equal to nil. Be careful though. If for example, we remove the second item from this table and the first and third item already initialized. The table pronounce item one nil and item three. Visible tables can't have gaps in them. So missing values will always show up as nil. Luckily, there's a table remove method which solves this problem. It takes in two parameters, the name of our table and the index we want to remove. We try removing the second item like before. You'll see it completely removes the gap in our table, which is very useful. If we wanted to remove the last item in our table and we didn't know how many items were in our table, we can index our table using # our table and set that equal to nil. This will always remove the last item of our table. If we try to print # our table, it'll print out free because there are three items in this table. Therefore, this line will always index the last item of our table and remove it. For tables, the index of the item is also called the key. If you want to add an item with a unique key, you can do this by wring the name of our table square brackets. Input a string and this string will be the name of our new key. Then make it equal to whatever value you want. You can also add a key by doing dot the name of the key then equal to whatever. They both do the same thing. It's just that with a string you can have spaces and special characters. And now you can see we have a unique key in our table. If you want to declare a table with a unique key beforehand, you can just write the key name inside the table and make it equal to whatever variable you want. Or you can use square brackets like our previous example. If we print this table, we can see our fourth item has a unique key which functions similar to a dictionary in other programming languages. If you wanted to remove this item from our table, we can't index it like we did before as this is a unique key and not a number. Instead, we'll have to index it using its key name and setting that equal to nil and then the item will be removed from our table. And just like with other keys, can print out the corresponding value by just indexing them. Before we cover the next data type, I want to quickly cover loops. There are three types of loops. for loops, while loops and repeat loops. This is a for loop. i= 1 is our starting index. This 1 is our step count. And this 10 is our final number. Every time a program reaches the last line of our loop, our index increases by the step count. It keeps looping until our index is greater than or equal to our final number, which in this case is 10. Since I is a value that's constantly increasing. If you print I inside of a loop, it'll print numbers from 1 to 10. If we were to increase the step count from 1 to two, it would print all the odd numbers from 1 to 10. And then increasing our final number from 10 to 100 would print all the odd numbers from 1 to 100. If you don't declare a step count, the program will just assume it's one. If we change a step count to zero or a negative number, nothing would actually happen. This is because Luo can detect this as an infinite loop and will ignore our loop to prevent it from crashing our program. We can also use loops to iterate through tables. Here we have a table. We declare two variables like this. I which is the index we're on item which will display a value in our table and then we pass in our table here. If we were to print item it would print all the values on our table one by one. This is because item is actually equal to our table index by i here. i increases by one each time we loop through this until i is equal to the total number of items in our table which in this case is three. But l initializes this as a variable which we can name here. In this case we named it item to represent each item individually in our table. It's important to know that I treat a little bit differently when looping through tables. If our table was a mix of numbered and unique keys, then if we tried printing I in our loop, it would give us the keys of our table and then the unique keys at the very end. No matter where our unique keys are in our table, they'll always be handled last. If you wanted to print out only our numbered keys, we can use a built-in method called IPAs and we can pass our table in here. This would only print out our numbered keys. There's also a regular pairs method, but as far as I can tell, it's completely useless for looping through tables as when you loop through a table on its own. L automatically uses pairs in the background. So, it won't matter. While loops while loops look like this, they're taking a boolean value here and they constantly loop until this condition becomes false. For example, if we use two is greater than one, this will simplify as true. However, this is bad as both these numbers are constants and therefore this condition can never break. These types of loops will loop infinitely and can be dangerous as they can crash your program. Let's use a variable. Every time this loop runs, this variable will decrease in value until the condition here is broken. As you can see, this prints out five times because after the fifth iteration, this condition is no longer true. So, it stops looping. Repeat loops. Repeat loops look like this. They're similar to while loops with two key differences. The first being with a while loop, the condition is checked before running the block of code. However, with a repeat loop, it checks the condition at the end of each loop. This means a block of code inside a repeat loop will always run at least once before a condition is met. And that leads us to the second difference. While loops will continuously loop until the condition becomes false. With a repeat loop, however, will continuously loop until the condition becomes true. There's also something called recursion, which is similar to a loop, but works a little differently. Recursion is when a function calls itself to repeat an action. Here we have a function called countdown and we'll make it take in a parameter called n which represent a number. Let's print n and if n is greater than one, we're going to call the function again. This time pass in n subtracted by one. This if statement is called the base case which will prevent the function from calling itself over and over to an infinite number of times. We can imagine how this function works if we were to call it down here and pass in a value. Let's pass in 8. The eight would go up here and then it would print 8 and since 8 is greater than one it would call the function again and this time pass in 8 minus 1 which is seven. Then it would pass in seven here and so on and so on until n is equal to 1 and since 1 is equal to 1 and not greater than it this condition will become false. Then our program could finally exit the function and no matter what number we pass in here it will always count down to one. Now this is a very simple example of recursion. Recursion is very similar to while and repeat loops. What sets it apart is that each function call can receive new arguments, allowing the function to build on its previous state. Because of this, recursion is often used for tasks such as depth first search and bre first search and traversing nested tables in general. Here's a more useful example of when we'd use recursion. Right now, what we want to do is print out each number individually in this table. But the catch is is that includes nested tables. Well, the way we can do this, we'll declare a function called print numbers and make it take in a value. We'll call the function down here and pass in this entire table. For our base case, we'll use a special type checking method called type of, which allows us to check what data type our value is. In this case, we want to check if it's a table. You could also use this method in future to check for different data types such as booleans or strings. If a value we pass in is a table, we're going to loop through it and call the function inside this loop, calling it for each item in our loop. If our value wasn't a table, this would mean it's a number, and therefore, we can print it out like this. And now if we were to run this program, it would print out all the numbers sequentially. And it doesn't matter how deep the nested tables are, it'll print all the numbers. Just keep in mind each time we call the function, it will be added to something called stack. Since our program does a new call for each value in our table, these call stack on top of each other. And if there's too many of them, our program may throw a runtime error, and we'd reach something called stack overflow. Stack overflow is quite rare of recursion as Lu's documented stack limit is 20,000 calls per thread, which is a very large amount. threads. An example of threads are co- routines. We can declare a co routine like this and pass in a function here. In order to run this, we need to use co- routine.resoom and pass in a cor routine here. And here we can see our cor routine is working. However, if we try to run this line again, you'll see it still only prints once. This is because our cor routine is dead. Coroutines have a special attribute called status. We can see what the statuses by writing corine. status and passing in our cor routine here. And if we were to print this before we run the resume line, we'll get the word suspended, which just means it hasn't run yet. If you print this again after the resume line, we get the word dead, which just means the corine won't do anything, even if you try resuming it. Inside a cor routine function, we can use something called corine.yield, which allows us to create increments of checkpoints inside the function. Therefore, if you run resume and resume again, then one more time, we can print these values one by one. And of course, if you do another resume, it won't do anything because our corine is now dead. Corines have four possible different statuses. Suspended, which just means the corine hasn't started yet or has paused. Running, which means it's running right now. Normal, which means a corine is resuming another corine. And dead, which just means the coroutine function has reached its end. If you were to print a corine status inside of its function, you're going to see it says running. Now, whenever a corine status goes to normal, it just means a coroutine is running another coroutine. And we can depict it like this with these two cor routines. We start by resuming the second one, which will resume the first. And whilst we're on the first, we can try to print out the status of coroutine 2. And as you can see, you get normal. There's also something called coroutine. It's similar to corine.create. But with coroutine. The corine can be called like a function. And as a result, you can return values too. It's basically just a normal function. But since it's a corine, you can add yields to add checkpoints to it like this. And just like other co- routines, it will die if the function reaches its last line. Do be careful though since we call the corine like a function. If you try calling it while the cor routine is dead and you'll get an error unlike with coroutine.res. There's also other ways to make threads such as task.spawn which creates a simple singular thread which ticks in a function as well which is one of the more common forms of threads. There's also taskde which runs but only when the main thread is finished running. There's also task delay which takes in two parameters a number and then a function and it will delay running the function by the number of seconds you put in here. There's also something called task.anc cancel, which can cancel any of these threads here, only if they haven't run yet, and they're most useful for canceling task or delay functions. This is extremely handy for making resetable timers. Here's an example of some code. Heal task is initially set to nil. When our function runs, this is a fancy way of checking if heel task is not equal to nil because if it isn't equal to nil, then it must be a thread in which the timer will get cancelled. Then heal task will be set back to nil. Then after that, you'd start a new 15-second timer. And then this code will run after 15 seconds, which will heal the player, which is super useful for important game mechanics such as combat tags and much more. There's also something called coroutine.unning, which can be declared into a variable. You can use it to check and access any C routine that's currently running in the background. Now, let's explain the main thread. The data type thread is a little bit misleading, and not to be confused with CPU threads. A better name for this data type is schedules. As in programming terms, you're not technically creating any new threads. A good example of a thread is this blue bar that executes code here. If you had multiple threads, then they'd be running in parallel, which is not what this data type does. All we do is slightly change the order in which code is executed in. Take this example. This is a while true loop. Added a tight to prevent our CPU from locking. If we add a print statement here, it won't print at all. This is because our thread is perpetually stuck in our loop. If we use a task.spawn here and put our loop inside of that function, you can see our print statement runs first before our loop. The way this works is that we'll wait to execute everything else first and then schedule our loop at the very end. If we have multiple while true loops wrapped around a taskspawn, it will schedule the priorities and execute them back and forth each time basically looping through these loops. It's very clear that they're not in parallel. It's still executed in serial, which just means line by line. And for the last data type, user data. User data is basically a custom predefined data type which are mainly in most game engines in Roblox. A good example of these are vector freeze, C frames, brick color, color free and etc. User data cannot be created in most game engines using their version of Lua alone. However, you can create your own user data in traditional LEA. However, you need to understand C or C++ to create real user data which I'm not going to explain in this video as it goes beyond our scope. Now that we've covered all data types, I want to briefly discuss the difference between global and local variables. Here we have an if statement. If you declare a global variable here, it can still be printed out here beyond the scope of this code. If we use a local variable, it'll print as nil, which is better as it can prevent our variable from being redeclared on accident. But let's say we have two variables in the very outer scope of our code. That mean they both act similar to global variables, right? Since the scope reaches the entire program or yes the scope does reach the entire program but local variables are still much better to use. To understand why we need to see how Lua actually runs behind the scenes. Lure code is executed by something called the Lure virtual machine. This virtual machine is written in C programming when Lua runs our code. Local variables are stored directly on stack. This makes them very easy to access since the virtual machine doesn't have to search for them. It knows exactly where they are in stack. Since global variables are global and their scope reaches the entire program even before they're declared. A virtual machine has to store it a little differently. It gets stored in a special table called env which is short for environment. Whenever your code has to access a global variable, the virtual machine has to look up using its hash key which is slower relative to local variables which can be accessed directly from stack. So even if both these exist at the top level of your code. Locals are still faster and more efficient. Anyways, that's all of luau. If you feel there's anything I've missed, feel free to leave a comment down below asking any question. Anyways, that's all.

6XxY_zrgzPI	The EASIEST Beginner's Guide to ROBLOX Scripting! (2025)	Scriptix	63515	44:14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XxY_zrgzPI	roblox scripting tutorial	all right guys in this video I'll be teaching you the fundamentals of Roblox scripting if you've never scripted before or are still new to it this is the video for you so to start off we'll insert a script into server script storage so first thing we want to cover is printing now when we open a script we see the infamous Line Print hello world now what does that line of code do to run the code basically what you want to do is go to test and run as you can see it prints hello world to the output window which is this tab right down here so basically print is a function that outputs whatever you place between the brackets to the output window and it can print all kinds of data types a data type is basically a way to classify the different forms in which information can be displayed so you have your primitive data types like numbers or strings strings are basically text like this another data type is Boolean values which are either true or false and there are also more complex data types like instances udum and Vector 3 values which we'll cover in a later video with that out of the way we can move on to properties so properties are things that objects like parts and guis have that can change so like size color position transparency just to name a few and you can find the properties that an object has in the properties window so if I had a part right here I can go down to this properties window and see all the properties it has when I have it selected now to change an object's property we have to locate its position inside the game all things inside Roblox Studio are under what's called game it's considered the parent of everything inside and next down in the hierarchy are these services like workspace and lighting and so on and finally at the bottom of the hierarchy we have the objects that are inside the services so you can think of services as children of game and the Bas plate for example since it's found inside of workspace it is the child of workspace and workspace is the parent of Bas PL now if we want to change the properties of something we'll have to use a script so we'll go back to the script we opened before and the first thing we have to do is we have to do what's called referencing basically what we're doing is we're locating the object whose property we want to change inside the game we're finding its location so we want to do game do workspace the dot indicates that whatever goes after belongs to the term that goes before so we know that workspace belongs to game we do workspace because the part we want to change is found inside of the workspace so we do game. workpace dopart and then since properties belong to the part we add another dot you can see a bunch of the properties that it has so let's say we want to change the transparency if you look in the properties tab transparency is a value that goes between 0o and 1 so when I get closer to one it gets more transparent so since it has a transparency of zero right now we'll increase the transparency to 0.75 so that it's almost completely transparent and the test the code we can go click run you can find it either under the test tab or the script tab so when we click run it'll execute that code as you can see the part is mostly transparent now you can barely see it over here another example I'll show you is the anchored property anchoring apart basically keeps it in its place so if you had anchored it will stay in the air without falling but if it's not anchored it will just fall out of the sky so I'm just going to run it now with it being anchored and you'll see that still floats in the sky anchored takes a Boolean value so in order to change it you do Gameworks space. part. anchored and instead of setting a number you either say that it's true or false true means it is anchored and false means it isn't anchored so if we want it to not be anchored we'll assign a value of false to it so game. workspace part. anchored equals false and when we run the code it stops being anchored and it falls out of the sky with that out of the way we can move on to variables so what are variables variables are just names that hold a value so any kind of data type can be stored with a variable so let me show you how to declare a variable the first thing you want to do is type the keyword local and then your variable name let's say we want to store a name so we can do local name equals scripts basically what we're doing is is we're creating a variable called name so basically this equal sign is assigning a value to name so whatever goes after the equal sign is what name will equal and I put scripts as a string whenever you reference the variable it will give you the value of name so we can print the variable to the output window basically what it'll do is it will print name it'll look back to what values assigned to it it will see that the string scriptx is assigned to it so it'll print scriptx to the output window and it does exactly what what we asked to build off of what you just learned about properties you can assign any object you want to variables so I can do local part equals G.W workpace dopart so what we're doing is we're assigning this part that we have here in workspace to this variable right here so instead of retyping game. workspace dopart every single time we can just do part dot whatever property we want to change so uh part do anchored equals false so instead of retyping game. workspace dopart every single time we can just use the variable name and it'll know that would referencing the part that's inside workspace so when we run it it executes the code correctly and it saves you a bunch of space and it makes your code look way more organized without other way let's move on to functions what are functions functions are blocks of code that are executed when you call it say you had a really long piece of code that you need to use over and over again would you copy and paste the entire thing every time you need to use it no you would make a function and call it by calling I mean you're telling it to run so let's make a function that adds two numbers together so the way you define a function is that you use the keyword local and then type function now you need to create a name for your function so since this function's purpose is to add numbers we'll call it add number after that use a set of brackets and then press enter and notice how it adds the word end at the bottom you need to have that when you're making functions so local function your function name followed by two brackets with the keyword end at the bottom so in between the first line and the bottom line is where the function will be this is the code that will be executed when you call it so let's say we want to add the numbers 3 and 2 which makes five we can store it in a variable and then print it out so we can do local result so we're creating a variable called result and we're assigning it to the sum of 3 + 2 and the last thing we want to do is we want to print the result to the output window now when you want to use the function you need to call it and you call the function by typing the function's name followed by the brackets if we didn't have this line here it wouldn't print anything at all because all you've done is Define the function but by calling it you're executing the code that's inside this block that's in here so we'll run the code and we'll see if it prints out five and it does all right but what if you needed a function that would change the output depending on the situation so if we need to add numbers we could use the function we wrote over here but what happens if we need to add different numbers every single time that's where parameters come in so parameters serve as variable placeholders which get assigned values when the function is called so parameters go in between these brackets over here you can name them anything you want treat them as variables without a value assigned to it so we'll call it num one and num two so there's two parameters separated by a comma so these two parameters will represent the numbers that will add together now when you're calling a function that has parameters you also have to specify arguments arguments are information that you send to the function so in this case we're sending two different numbers we want add together so let's say 5 and four and remember what I said about the parameters being placeholders well when you call the function num one gets assigned whatever value you passed on as the first argument so in this case num one will become five and then num two will become four last thing we want to do we want to modify what the result equals so instead of adding three and two together we want to add num one and num two together so when we call this function and we pass the values of five and four num one equals 5 and then num 2 equals 4 and then the result adds the two numbers together so 5 + 4 equal 9 so let's run it and see if we get N9 and it does and you can change the arguments whenever you want so you can change it to 10 and 7 and you wouldn't have to change the actual function itself you just have to change the ARG arguments so when we run that it'll take 10 and seven it'll add it together and it'll get you 17 great so now we can add any numbers that we want using the same function so what if we want to use the answer instead of just printing it out could we like add add five to the answer so could we do result equals result + 5 we'll run that and we'll see we get an error here because we're trying to add a number with a nil value a nil value just means it has no value so you can't add nothing and five and the reason it's nothing is because result is a local variable so it only exists within the code Block in which it's defined so in this case it only exists within this block of code so when we're trying to access it outside of the block it doesn't work so how do we access values that we produced in functions this is where returning comes into play returning basically sends the information back to where you call it the function so the way we return the result is we use the keyword return and then the value on return so return result now what this does is when you add the two numbers together it'll send the result so 10 + 7 is 17 and it'll send it back to this line over here so what we can do is we can assign a variable to it so we can do local answer equals add numbers 10 and 7 basically when you call it it'll add them together and it will return 17 to this line over here and it will assign the variable answer to 17 so I'll show you as proof let's say we wanted to add five to it so answer equals answer plus five and we'll print answer out here basically what we're doing is we're creating variable called answer and we're setting it to the return value of this function call over here so we'll add 10 + 7 which is 17 so it'll assign 17 to the variable answer and now we're adding five onto answer and setting it back to the same variable which is 22 so this should print 22 oh let's remove the print statement first and it prints 22 now you can even return more than one thing at a time so let's say we want to add the numbers together but we also want to subtract them so we can do local sum equals num1 plus num 2 but then local difference equals num 1 minus num 2 now returning is useful because you can also return one one value so you can do return sum difference separated by a comma basically to get the value outside of the function you would have to have two separate variables as well so local sum difference so basically sum would be the first variable and then difference would be the second variable so the two numbers are assigned separately so 10 + 7 is 17 and then for the difference 10 - 7 is 3 so it'll return 17 comma 3 so that means this variable here the first variable sum would be 17 and then the second variable will be three I can print them out separately as well just to show you and it prints 17 and three and that's everything you need to know for functions now on to if statements all right so if statements or conditional statements are lines of code that only run if certain conditions are met so to make things clear I'll show you what that looks like you start a conditional statement by typing if and then your condition then and then you press enter so what this is saying is that if this condition is met then we'll execute everything inside this block of code we conclude the if statement by typing the word end at the bottom so let's say we want to check if the temperature is cold outside to do that we'll have a variable here at the beginning call it temperature we'll set it equal to 10° 10° is pretty cold and in between the if and then we'll have the condition so we want to check if let's say the temperature is less than 20° if it's less than 20° it's cold and we want to print that out so this comparison operator here this alligator mouth opens its mouth to the larger number so what it's saying is if the temperature is less than 20 then we execute the code that's inside the spot in this case we're printing out it's cold so since 10 is less than 20 then it'll execute the code inside the block so we'll run this and we see that its cold is printed to the output window now there's a few comparison operators I'd like to talk about so this one is the less than operator you can also have the alligator mouth open on the other side so this is saying if temperature is greater than 20 this double equal sign is if temperature is equal to 20 this operator is saying if temperature is not equal to 20 so if it's anything except 20 then the condition is meant and it'll run the that's inside remember conditional statements only execute the code inside the block if the condition is true so in this case since temperature is not equal to 20 10 is not equal to 20 the condition is met so it'll run the code that's inside you also have other operator such as the greater than or equal to so if the temperature is greater than or equal to 20 so if it's 20 or above it'll run this code inside you can also switch the direction of the alligator mouth and this is if the temperature is less than or equal to 20 all right but what if the temperature was not less than 20 so what if it was 30° 30° is pretty hot so what we'll do is We'll add an lse statement basically the purpose of the else statement is to run the code inside the second block over here if this condition is not met so we first check if temperature is less than 20 if it is less than 20 we'll run this code inside but but if it's not less than 20 then we'll run this code inside the second block so if it's not cold it's hot and we'll change the temperature to 30 so it will check if the temperature is less than 20 30 is not less than 20 so it skips this block inside and it goes to this else statement which runs if the other checks are false or not met so it'll print its hot and that's what it shows in the output all right but what if we had something in the middle like what what if we want to check if it was warm like not too hot and not too cold that's what else if is for so else if is basically providing another check for it to complete before it moves onto the else statement so we use an else if statement by typing else if and then the conditions so the first thing we checked was if it was less than 20 now I guess we want to check if it's less than 25 so if it's less than 25 we'll say that it's warm if it's not less than 20 and not less than 25 then the temperature must be above 25 which is hot so if we place a number in between so like 24 it will first check if the temperature is less than 20 which is not because 24 is bigger than 20 so it ignores this statement over here then it will check the second statement so it'll check if the temperature is less than 25 and since 24 is less than 25 then it'll print its war and that's what it prints out so so this lse statement over here only prints something if all the other conditions are not met so the second one of the conditions is met it'll ignore everything else that's below it so if the temperature was 15° then it meets this first statement because 15 is less than 20 so it'll print its cold and then it'll ignore everything else that's down here so to recap conditional statements are to check if certain conditions are met in this case we wrote code that made sure the temperature was between a certain degree we want to check if it was cold or if it was warm or if it was hot so the else if statements are just a secondary if statement to check another condition provided that the first one was not met and then the else block over here only runs if everything else is false so that's it for conditional statements all right so the next topic we want to cover are tables a table is a data type that allows you to store multiple values of any type so we can define a table by by doing local t t for table and then curly brackets that's a table so let's fill it up with some strings so the different values inside a table are separated by commas so here we have a table with three elements inside scrips is cool all separated by commas so each element corresponds with an index which is essentially its position that's inside the table what we have here is a certain type of table called an array an array is an ordered list of values meaning they have numerical indexes so to reference the position of each element we use numbers so this first element over here is index one this second value over here is index 2 and this third value over here is index 3 now we can print specific elements of the table so we can do print T and to print specific elements of a table we we basically insert square brackets followed by the index so let's say we want to print the first value so we print T square brackets 1 so why don't you take a guess of what it will print if you guess it'll print scrips then you're correct because scrips is the first element inside so when we do T square brackets one it goes into the table and it looks for the first element which is scriptx so when we print that out scriptx is what you see now arrays have many built-in functions inside some of the more common ones are table do find table do remove and table do insert so I'll show you how you can use each one of these so we'll start with table. find so table. find takes two parameters so the first thing we want to do is want to pass on the array so we we pass on T and then we want to pass on the value we want to find so say we want to find the value cool what table.in does is it'll look for whatever value you provided and it'll return the index you found it at so we can print out the result so when we print out table.in T comma cool this function will look for the word cool inside and it'll return the index at which it founded at so since cool is found at index x 1 2 3 it'll print out three that's what it does now table. remove does something else table. remove removes a certain value from the table so we pass on the table and then we pass on the position at which we want to remove so let's say we want to remove the first index which is index one so table. remove will go inside this table they look at the index at which you provided which is one so it's the first one it'll remove the first element inside so the table will be the same thing except it doesn't have the first element inside so we'll execute this function and then we'll print the table out just so I can show you that the first element is actually removed as you can see the table only has two elements remaining and you can see the first element we had before is gone the last function I want to cover was table do insert table do insert basically inserts the value provided to the end of the table so when we insert bananas to the array the array will have four elements it'll be scrips is cool bananas so we'll print that out and run the code and we can see that bananas has been added on to the end of the array now there's another type of table called a dictionary so a dictionary is just like like an array except instead of using numbers as indexes you have specific values called keys we use so to define a dictionary we'll just do local dictionary equals and then the curly brackets and I'll just press enter so we can space out the brackets so we can actually add the values inside the keys are the names that you assign to the values inside the dictionary so essentially it's kind of like mini variables inside the dictionary so we'll do name you surround the key name with square brackets and then you type equals and we'll write the value we want so name equals scripts and then comma and then you can have another key let's call it favorite color and we'll say that equals green and we'll have one more value that says is cool and we'll set that to a ban value true it's true because I'm cool so that's a dictionary all right so to print specific values inside the dictionary you have to reference its key name so you do dictionary square brackets and then the key name we want so let's say we want to print my name so we'll do dictionary square brackets name and it'll look back on the dictionary over here it'll look for a key called name which is this first line over here and then it'll print the value associated with that key so when we print dictionary square brackets name it will print script now dictionaries don't have those built-in table functions like arrays do if we want to add a new value like a new key inside the dictionary we'll do dictionary square brackets and then the new key name so we'll say favorite number we set it equal to whatever we want so let's say my favorite number is 10 what this line does is it'll insert a new key inside the dictionary so it's essentially doing the same thing as adding a comma in and then sticking this line inside now dictionaries are not ordered so when you print out the key value pairs so name is the key and scripts is the value so when you print a dictionary the keys might not be in order so when we print out the dictionary it might be favorite color equals green that comes first and then is cool equals true and then finally name equals scrips so unlike arrays dictionaries are not ordered and you can remove dictionary keys by typing the key you want so let's say I want to remove is cool and the way we delete the key is we set it equal to nil nil means nothing so we set it to a non-existent value so when we print the dictionary we'll see that is cool is gone we'll print it once before we remove the key and we'll print it once after so the first time we print it we got favorite color equals green is cool equals true and name equal scrips notice how they're not in the order that we Define them in because dictionaries are not ordered and then the second time we print it is cool is gone you can see that there's only favorite color and name all right so now I want to talk about built-in functions Roblox has its own functions that they've built into Roblox Studio that are already pre-written and you can call whenever you want so if you want to see what built-in functions Roblox has you want to go to the object Explorer so you go under View and click object browser so on the left panel over here you have all the objects and instances and services that are inside Roblox let's say we want to browse for parts so on the right panel here you have all of the built-in functions that it has you've got add tag clone destroy f for child get actor and a whole bunch of other functions you'll also see that it has all the properties like color and anchored and name or material and it has a bunch of events connected to it as well but what we're looking at is the functions so I'm showing you that or most subjects have their own built-in functions that Roblox has already coded for you so I'm going to explore a few of them with you here so the most simplest one you've already seen is print and print just allows you to print things to the output window another really commonly used built-in function is task. we and this basically pauses the script for a certain amount of time so you would specify the number inside here say I wanted to wait 1 second I would do task. we 1 if I wanted to wait half a second I would do task. weight 0.5 now the next two I'm going to talk about are really similar so you have find first child and wait for child so let's say I was looking for a part that was inside something else so let's say I was looking for the base plate and it's found inside a workspace you could do game. workpace find first child and then in Brackets you put quotation marks the name of the object that you're looking for so Gameworks space. based playay you can also do the same thing with wait for child now the difference between find first child and wait for child is that F first child look ins set the area that you specified in this case it's game. workspace and it will return the first object with the value you specified so it will return the first object with the name base plate but if it can't find anything with that name it will return nil and nil basically means no value so if I do local part equals game. workspace find for child Bas plate it will look inside workspace it will find base plate and it will assign base plate to this variable over here now wait for child will pause the script until it finds the object with that name the problem with that is if there's no base plate it will pause the script forever and it won't continue to run so wait for child is only good when you know that object is going to be there so it basically Waits a certain amount of time before it prints the warning that it can't find the thing you're looking for so if I look for my cool part basically the script will pause forever because it can't find anything called my cool part inside it says infinite yield possible it means the script will pause infinitely until it finds that part but since there isn't any such part it will pause the script forever so wait for child is only good if you know that object is already there or you know that object is going to be there after you call it all right the last buil-in function I want to talk about is get children this function returns a table of everything inside the object that you specified so say I had a folder and I put all the parts that I could see inside that folder so let's call it my folder so if I do local Parts equals game. workpace do myfolder get children it basically returns an array containing everything inside so it's essentially the same thing as doing local Parts equals spawn location base plate and part so it will return everything inside the folder in the form of an array to show you that it's true I can print parts so it'll go look inside Gameworks space. folder and it'll get all its children inside so these three parts over here and then it'll put it in an array and when I print the variable Parts it will print the array containing all three parts and there you go all right so the next thing I want to talk about are Loops so Loops are basically these structures that allow you to repeat certain things over and over again until you tell it to stop so the first kind of loop is called a wild Loop and the way you define a wild Loop is you type while true do with the word end at the bottom basically what a wild Loop does is it continuously runs the code that's inside the block until you tell it to stop so if I said print high the wild Loop will continuously print high on and on and on forever now when you're using Loops it's not a good idea to leave it like this and I'll show you why so let's run it it lagged my laptop massively and it tells me script timeout exhausted allowed execution time so basically you've kind of overwhelmed Roblox Studio because it basically prints high so quickly it takes up all the memory so the way you prevent it is that you add a task. weight inside basically it will execute the code inside the block so it'll print high then it'll wait 1 second and then it'll print high again again that way you're not going too fast so if I run it now I should have no problems at all and you can see it increases over time I mean you can make this number really small just don't have it without the task. weight like I can do task. 0.05 it'll print high really quickly but not as quickly as before and it won't crash the way you break out of a loop is that you type the word break so in this case it will print high and then it'll wait 0.05 5 seconds and then it'll break out of the loop so in this case it'll only print high once and then it will stop and that's what it does the next kind of loop is called a repeat until Loop the way you define a repeat until Loop is that you type repeat enter and you'll see it says repeat until so that's the structure you want to follow so similarly to a wild Loop a repeat until Loop continuously runs the code that's inside the block block except that it runs it until a certain condition is met so right after the word until is where you write your condition kind of like an if statement let's say we wanted a counter and we want it to stop at 100 so we'll do local counter equal Z we will add one to the counter so we do counter equals counter + 1 so at the first run it'll set counter to a new value and that new value will be itself which which is 0 and then you add one to it so 0 + 1 is 1 and then it Loops again counter equals 1 + 1 which is two so it it increases by one every single time now after the until we'll write the conditions so we'll say until counter is equal to 100 so we want to break when it's 100 we'll also print the value of counter to illustrate it and obviously we want the task. weight we don't want Studio to crack so we'll do like every 05 seconds and we'll run that and it goes up from zero to 100 and it should stop at 100 and that's what it does so the until part of it kind of acts as a breaking statement so as soon as this statement is met we break out of the loop all right so the last kind of loop is called a four Loop so a four Loop is also called a counted Loop because you can use it to count count up numbers kind of like what we did with the repeat wild Loop but in different format so the way you define a for Loop is you type four and then you have your variable name so we'll call it counter and then equals and then it's followed by three numbers the starting number the ending number and the increment number so let's say we want to start at zero end at 10 and the increment number is how much we go up or down by so let's say we want to go up by one so for counter equals 0 comma 10 comma 1 we do so write do at the end and enter basically this four Loop it'll execute the code inside the block until the condition that counter equals 10 is met the first time it goes through the block here counter equals Zer and then when we get back to the top we add one to counter so counter equals 1 and then we go through the block again and now counter equals 2 and it keeps going until counter equals 10 and to illustrate this point we can do print counter counter to show you how the counter adds up so it starts at zero and it goes all the way up to 10 I should also mention that it's important to put the task. weight in here as well as for all other Loops in this case it didn't crash because we only had to go through it 11 times now for Loops are useful because they can iterate through tables so let's say we had a table here with a bunch of different values Bob show banana Roblox so a for Loop can also go through tables so if we want to go through an array we can do for index value in my Pairs and then the table basically what this does is it'll go through this table over here and notice how we have two variables over here this index value basically will print the position it's found at and then the value value variable will print the element that's at that index so to illustrate my point I'll print the index and then I'll print the value the first time it goes through the loop it prints index which starts at one for arrays so it prints one it'll print the value associated with that index which is Bob so one Bob and then it goes back to the top and it goes to the next index so since we start with index one now we're at index 2 so it prints two 2 and it looks for the element found at index 2 which is Joe so 2 Joe and the next time it goes around it's index 3 so it prints three and it looks for the element associated with that value which is banana and then finally it Loops through one more time it prints index 4 which is Roblox you can also Loop through dictionary so let's make a dictionary so let's say we had a dictionary we can Loop through the dictionary by doing four key value in pairs so instead of I pairs we do in pairs and then the dictionary name do and then enter now I'd like to make a note that the two variables that we have over here are just placeholders so you can name it anything you want and it won't change anything so we can print the value and key pairs it's basically the same thing we did with the arrays except that instead of having indexes as you do in arrays you have keys which are these things over here which help identify the value associated with it so when we print key and value it will print the specific key that we're looking at and then the value associated with that key so we'll run that so it prints the key so subscriber count and then it'll print the value associated with it which is 285 in this case and notice how they don't print it in order so I wrote name first but then it print a subscriber count first so that's the thing with dictionaries they are not ordered so when you iterate through them it might not be in the exact order that you wrote it as just a thing to keep in mind and those are the three different kinds of Loops now we will talk about events so what are events so events are basically these things on Roblox that wait for something to happen so let's say you had a part now we can go inside the object browser like we did before and we can go to part and we can look at all the events it has so you have changed child added destroying touched and we'll look at touched which is the most self-explanatory one so the touched event for a part basically fires when the part gets touched by something so think of events like these listeners that will wait until something happens something specific happens before for firing events allow you to connect functions to them so when an event fires you can have it trigger a function so you can get it to do something when that event is fired so let's say we wanted to connect a touched event to this part over here now let's rename the part first to make it a little more specific we'll call it cool part so we can reference the part using a variable so local cool part equals game. work space. cool part now the way you define an event is that you do cool part so you write the object name Dot and then the event you want to Define so cool part. touched and we want to have it do something when it gets touch so we want to connect a function to it and the way you connect the function to it is you do colon connect and then you type function kind of like when you're defining a function and another set of brackets I then remove the last bracket here here and then press enter so cool part. touch colon connect bracket function end basically what this event does is that it'll listen and wait until cool part gets touched and once it gets touched it fires the event which is connected to a function so it'll essentially call the function which is defined inside this block over here so whatever code you have inside here will run when the part gets touched let's say we want to make it transparent so we can do cool part. transparency equals 0.5 so when we touch the part it'll turn the transparency to 0.5 so let's play test it so I'm here with cool part and when I touch it it should turn semi-transparent cuz I set the transparency to 0.5 so when I touch it it's it's now partially invisible all right so to demonstrate my point again we'll use a different event this time we'll use one of the built-in events for the player service so let's say we want to check when a player joins so the way you do that is you do game. players you reference the service and then you do Dot and the event is called player added now you can see it right here with a lightning bolt so when you click on it you can see some more information about it so it fires when a player enters the game so we do game. players. player added and we want to connect a function to it connect function and then the end at the bottom now the player added event takes a parameter so in between the two brackets after function you can type in a parameter name the argument that's passed is the actual player that join so whenever the player joins this event gets fired and it will pass the player object as as a parameter and you can do a whole bunch of things with it so I can print the player's name so you can do player. name I can print the player's user ID so when I click play I will join the game and then this player added event will get fired which is connected to a function the function has a parameter called player and it takes the player object as the argument so when I press play I'm joining the game and it prints the username screen itics and then my user ID so recap events are basically these listeners that wait for certain things to happen and you can connect functions to it so that it executes code when that event gets triggered and that's about everything you need to know for the basics of scripting on Roblox so we've covered printing properties variables functions if statements tables built-in functions looping and now events and if you're looking for any other tutorials leave a comment down in the comments below thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you in the

Lry2eC9vGzA	I Spent 24 HOURS Learning Scripting In Roblox	janisjanis01	56478	15:50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry2eC9vGzA	roblox scripting tutorial	for the next 24 hours I'll be learning on how to script in Roblox Studio I'm going to be using multiple working methods on how to learn scripting super fast hopefully become a scripting God by the end of the video myself I barely have any knowledge in scripting so this is going to be super fun and useful by the end of the video I need to make a Obby with only scripts that means I can't place any parts and everything has to be done through scripts just already imagine mowing aart with only code yeah this is going to be fun will I become a scripting God or completely fail stay tuned to find out so I started off by just doing what pretty much everyone that do use YouTube you can learn pretty much anything on YouTube nowadays so I searched up the fastest method to learn scripting I found a video by smarty that claimed that it will teach me beginner level scripting and I watched it all the way through after watching smarty's video I have learned the basics of scripting I'm going to quickly resume what I learned so print statements can be used to find the error in your code and can be used with string values Bing values and number values Nan scripting basically equals nothing with instances you can insert any object inside of Roblox Studio remember I need to make my own Obby with only scripts so I'm going to be using instances a lot all right if statements can be used if you want to check for something for example if the part is anchored then print the part is anchored and if it's not you can use else for example to destroy the part events no not those type of events Roblox Studio events there are a lot of them and you can find them in the Roblox Studio object browser but the most useful one is touched you can use it to detect when someone touches a part you can use a while loop to Loop through a part of a code while something is set to true for example this code is going to Loop until test is set to true then using break it will stop looping through the code I'm almost ready to start creating the Obby but there is one more secret method that nobody really knows about it's a Roblox game called Lola learning so what do we have here we have tutorials submitted by actual Roblox scriptors and players this game offers multiple lessons starting from the basics to the intermediate level I already know the basics so I moved on to the second chapter print two statements first check the type of any string value then check the type of a bulling value yeah I'm so proud that I was able to do the task in the first try let's just skip the boring part but for the next hour I spent my time completing all of these tasks now it was time for the fun part the game offers fun quests that you need to solve with code let's first of all make a function the player move forward yeah to be honest I don't know what I'm doing I don't think there's even a function like this in Roblox so I try to take a different approach and it actually works equipped with the best knowledge I can finally start creating my Obby so we are finally ready to create our Obby and I can use only scripts that means I cannot insert Parts I cannot color them and everything has to be done through scripts so I started my journey by creating a new script called part spawner I wrote a code to spawn in a part inside of work space but it didn't go as planned um where is our part also remember I have to make a wall Lobby like this I guess we can add print statements so I actually don't know what I'm doing then I was doing something completely unnecessary and I didn't realize the part was already there okay I finally realized they needs anchor the part and set its position to something oh it's a vector 3 value I got it so I fixed up the eror and used Vector 3. new and set the part size to 5 comma 1 comma 10 yo it actually works let's go after what felt like ages I finally made a decent spawn location and now I can move on to make the stages I tried making a new script for each one of the parts and adjust the X Y and Z axis I mean it worked but it wasn't effective so I merged all of the scripts together into one big script so I think this is going to be it for the first stage you know what let's actually get rid of the base plate script the parent destroy then I inserted the new script for the second stage and I was so confused on how to make the platform spawn in the right place the size okay this should work hopefully yeah let's go it works why is the first jump so big and now it's so small but I would want to add checkpoints later I'm right I did add checkpoints later but they took me ages to make this already hurts my brain I cannot even see the Obby and and it's so hard I tried adjusting the size and position for the first obstacle on the second stage but yeah something was wrong now the wall game is not working great oh my bad I can't insert a new instance called stage has to be a part I need to somehow find the center of this part and I need to measure it in studs so I can yeah it's way too complicated yeah as you can tell everything was going downhill until I actually fixed the part and I was so hyped I don't know why next I needed to add the kill bricks so I adjusted the size and colored them bright red yo it's actually neon now I think we should space out the next ones by around let's say six studs so I copied the script a bunch of times and made each part six studs further away let's go now I need to make the kill Parts actually kill you so player touched. connect I don't know what I'm doing to be honest I was still a pretty big Noob at scripting but I have already learned a lot since I was able to create the function after a couple of attempts yo it works let's go finally so now we need to create the third stage let's insert a new script for that so then I copied the spawn location part and adjusted the position to place it at the end of the second stage for the third stage I wanted to try to rotate the part minus 45° and it turned out pretty nice so I copied them a bunch of times and adjusted the position a bit to finally finish the stage on to the next stage so let's name this script stage 4 I took the spawn location from the first stage and messed around with the position to place it at the start of the fourth stage I could try to make something interesting for the fourth stage like those fading platforms that slowly fade until you fall right through so let's copy this so let's for the size let's do something like I'd say 40 * 20 then for the position let's do 60 and this should work let's see yeah it didn't work so I had to change up the position a bit I tried writing a fading script but to be honest I had no clue what I was doing so lost right now while I was looking through the Roblox Creator Hub I found the perfect script for my game it had just what I needed the fade function so I added the function to my C and tested it out let's quickly do our Obby I need shift lock no now it should start slowly fading yeah this is straight up impossible so I changed the rate variable to something a little bit higher so let's see if we can walk over in time yeah it's doable now to get the spawn location for the fifth stage I just copied the first script and move the platform 13 studs in the air I mean it looks all right for the fifth stage I want to to make this obstacle where you have to jump from one ball to another ball so I tried writing a script for that that spawns in a spear but it wasn't really working so I looked it up on the Roblox D forum and I found this script that I'm going to use yeah this is absolutely perfect for stage five let's copy a lot of these balls then I wanted to test out the new stage but it didn't go as planned oh my God why can't I do my own Obby yeah I wish I could add admin commands but I cannot place any parts let's just pretend that never happened yo finally we're up here and these jumps are impossible okay for the sixth stage I want to do something harder because each stage gets progressively more difficult so I tried spawning a one St jump okay uh nope it's the wrong direction I fixed the problem by changing its direction and I copy and pasted it a lot of times making each part two studs higher in there what did I even make right here why is that one so far away yeah I might have accidentally set the parts position to 200 instead of 20 now it looks a lot better the stage wasn't fully complete yet so I copied these parts a bunch of times and made the spawn location for the seventh stage let's go finally something is working okay I don't know what happened to my footage but making the seventh stage took ages it was so hard to spawn in the kill bricks and right areas then I tried spawning in the next platform and this happened okay I'm genuinely confused how did I even make this I accidentally set the size to 41 instead of the position so now it should be fixed yeah there we go for the eighth stage I'm going to make it very simple it's going to be just one part but there's a catch it's going to be rotating and it's going to be very hard to balance on I try to copy the function from the forth stage and changing the transparen to orientation but yeah as you can see it's not rotating so I have to take a different approach on how to resolve this so I try to use C frame to rotate the part but yeah let me just show you what happened let's go and finally at the top please work no then I switched back to using Vector 3. new and also added a task. weight so the game doesn't crash and guess what we have to do again we have to complete this wall Obby again first of all I don't want it to rotate this way second of all it's rotating super slow I was getting frustrated because I couldn't make the part spin correctly until I decided to make the code know what is the part's position and then make it rotate now it should work which means for the 100th time I have to complete this godamn Obby yo it's actually working it's rotating how it should now I just needed the end platform so I copied the first spa location and placed the 42 studs in the air now we have eight stages that are completely made with only code I don't even know how I made all of this but now I want to add checkpoints I don't even know if that's possible but we'll have to see so to do that I have to figure out a system to spawn all of the checkpoints inside of a folder and make them to be on the top of the big platform I started off by inserting a checkpoints folder which will contain all of the checkpoints and I try to insert a port but for some reason it wasn't in the checkpoints folder so I tried to adjust the position and name it stage one yeah there is an error but luckily I just miss spelled Vector 3 I continued on to insert new checkpoints for each one of the stage and colored them red they look pretty cool but now I have to make them work so I started off by just writing a simple later stat script that inserts a folder and an in value but also I need a script that updates Your Leader stats and makes you respawn on the checkpoint so I tried to Lop through all of the checkpoints and add plus one wue to the Player's leader stats player added is not a wallid member of players yeah I got an error but I figured it out and it was just a typo I misspelled player added yeah the folder is not getting created oh I literally just forgot to do this to Stage I just copied the whole part of the script and I forgot to rename it to Stage finally the leader stats folder got created but there was a bigger problem that was coming in my way yeah yeah it looks like we have a slight problem plus if we reset um yeah we're back at here boom we don't need that script anymore and I'm going to write a completely new one this one will move the character to the checkpoint and hopefully won't go crazy on adding volumes shoot there are already a couple of Errors I need to fix so after a little bit of thinking I figured out what I need to do in my checkpoints Handler script the checkpoints are named stage one stage two and Etc you know but I need to name them like 1 2 3 and Etc it should work like that oh my God my spelling is so awful today I pray that it works now why I'm already at the first stage oh come on I tried to resolve this in many ways well the first one was to name the first spawn location zero and pray that it works yeah that's not going to happen then I tried to add a part on top of the spawn location and name it zero the part is invisible but it acts like the first checkpoint yeah now you're spawning properly and please I hope the checkpoint system will work we got the volue and now if we reset yo it actually works I'm so relieved now this took ages to make let's go I'm now glad that the checkpoint system works but you know what would be cool if there was a button that a player needs to click to spawn in the Obby yeah this idea was great but nearly impossible I tried inserting the button through screen Dr I I mean that was working but making it actually spawn the Obby was quite impossible I tried everything whooping through all of the parts and making them invisible disabling enabling scripts adding weight variables to stop the scripts but nothing worked even though this idea was amazing I just couldn't do it usually I would stay up till 3:00 a.m. to fix the issue but this time there was a time limit and the time was running out okay enough with the dramatic stuff but it was sad that I couldn't make it work but that's when I got a even better idea I will make animals fall right from the sky and players will have to dodge them to complete the hobby so I added a new script in server script service and I don't know why I named it anchor falling script it should have been anvils instead of anchors anyways I used the while loop and math. random to spawn Parts randomly in the air but it wasn't as easy as it seems CPT service attempt to compare number to nil my bad I forgot to set the part count to zero the code was working but it wasn't spawning the anvils in the right place so I changed up the code a little bit and yeah this happened yo what as you can see the code needed a lot of adjustments so I changed the math out random values and also made the script wait for 4 seconds and then destroy all of the anvils otherwise it would just crash the game yeah the parts are spawning way too fast so I made the script wait for 0.3 seconds and with that my Obby is finally done if you want to play it I will leave a link in the description So after 24 hours did I really become a scripting god well kind of I learned a lot on this journey but as a wise man once said there's always room for improvement	14669	t	This content provides high SEO value by demonstrating

acQfvDNW5oM	I Learned How To SCRIPT In 24 HOURS | Roblox	Boxy	28137	10:39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acQfvDNW5oM	roblox scripting tutorial	I'm tired of you guys making fun of me because I can't script so I'm going to spend the next 24 hours learning the script if you ever came across my channel before you would notice I use AI a lot my biggest video is me using Ai and I use AI because I can't script so why not just learn scripting you got lit than 24 hours it should be easy you only got 24 hours right you literally only have 20 okay I get it ever since a small little box I wanted to make video games but I didn't really understand what went into making a game and I didn't want to learn everything so I procrastinated and procrastinated and procrastinated up until 1,100 and 93 days ago I made my first game it was not a good game but it started my Roblox Game Dev Journey on this day I attempted to make my first game it was supposed to be a piggy Style game called Bella but I gave up on it cuz I didn't know how to make a menu and at the time I was like 12 so my brain was not developed yet and it's still not on this day I de started to make my at the time dream game but all it was was a trash Obby you had a knife and a gun to kill people while you're completing the Obby because you're trying to race to get the golden gun it sounded cooler in my head in the game I had this wall of cool it was just a wall with my friend avatars and yes this is me I had drip not going to lie hold up go back a little bit all right stop here you might wonder why it took almost a oneyear break well it's because I didn't know how to script so I'm doing this for the old me to get our brain worked up and see how much I already know let's do a little quiz this parent is part uh what would you do oh oh oh I'm stupid what's the name of the oh oh hold up I know something got 1 minute left 90% accurate now that my brain is nice and warmed up I think it's time for me to try and script something disclaimer I'm not a script my scripting is bad I'm really slow so if you laugh at me I'm going find you and kill you enjoy okay so now I'm trying to script without learning anything yetay I'm going trying to make this part if you touch it it deletes or something like that loal part equals um what's local part equals okay so this is kind of embarrassing but when I started this I just woke up so my brain was still stupid script. parent uh 2,000 years later I L know nothing about scripting a few moments later after what felt like forever I got it to work Bingo it's easy I'm him I know how to script now after that minor success no Diddy I tried scripting another part here's the script if you want to see it I'm not sure if I did good or not let me know even know if yaen it's time to start the actual challenge to learn scripting I'm going to use BR dev's basic scripting Series so let's get started young little Newber doesn't know anything about game developmental guide we're going to use this Bas play template right here this template that we just selected then we can see that there's actually stuff so I'm kind of just moving this part around a little bit so um so far I learned nothing the next video on the series was to learn printing not the flex or nothing I already know how to print ladies please keep your pants on I know I'm just so talented it's 1 hour in I'm going to try and make a game you know The Fall Guys game hexagon I'm going to remake that but in like 9 minutes this should be easy so first I made a tile then I made a lot of tiles then I deleted the tiles and had one tile the scripting part was pretty easy but I still took a long time because you know my brain is um not the fastest but I ended up getting it to work and now all I got to do is duplicate the tiles wee now we got a working hexagon game who said scripting was hard now that we just learn about now that we just learn about functions it's time to actually script a function I already no this about functions so it's not that hard for me to do it boom make a script local function box heads boom script. parent and now if I play the game Sid right here side going to go down side's going to go up and siid back down I already told you I know about scripting so I'm like that good I'm goated bro I told my brother to give me something simple to script and it's what he said um B flickers when you touch it flickers let me put that in English he wants me to make a ball that flickers when you touch it ball script done I don't want to say it again but honestly scripting is way too easy to make the video not just me doing tutorials let's do this random game I found back yeah I'm not with check out I just made the lapop take a snap you at first I was a little confused I was like what is this this a even teaching me scripting then I realized it was using built-in functions and not teaching me scripting oh yeah let's make Arnold get that bag he want that money for real yeah good job aror so proud of you I'm arold one of the only subscribers on youtube.com breaking news Arnold box head reported missing after recording his part for the only Box's video If you see or hear anything from him please content 3-4 7-3 or text us said haha Arnold got taken subscribe by the way that game lowkey click baited me player. move forward does not exist all not going to lie this is too much work arold you got this yes master freak freak freak freak I don't know what I'm doing arold cooked up a nice script where you click the part and the ball changes colors I did not force him trust me me I did not kidnap him I'm not the reason he went missing trust me now it's time to give myself 30 minutes to script the game I decided on trying to make an escape room because it sound pretty simple to make at least for my skills I began with building the first room I didn't want to spend much time on the builds cuz I wanted the script and in this room all you're going to do is Click apart and the door will open the script is pretty simple cuz this basically all I've been doing this whole time look at Arnold go and as you see when you click the button the door opens then you can right click to close it if you wonder why I made it right click to close the door because at the time I did not learn if statements I ended up adding small touches to it by making a sound play when you click and the button turns red when the doors open next I decided to work on the second room this room is basically a Obby where you jump into Parts but after a few seconds you can fall through it guys how do I add a debounce time was up but I still wanted to practice my skills so I decided to make a kill part I ly went tool blockx and read the script and then try to memorize it and then kind of copied it but it's okay I kind of learned a little bit I made a script so if you push the part to another part the part the part opens part cuz yeah part opens part yeah I'm not going to lie I don't feel like I'm learning much hopefully the script stay in my brain I don't forget it but it's 1:00 a.m. so I'm going to sleep tell want some love you need some love you need some trust are gone and they BT up I'm the problem but you can't Sol I totally didn't wake up 30 minutes before the 24 hours was up and now I'm panicking and stressing outz I got nothing to show you guys cuz I been doing the same thing all day what am I doing with my life torturing myself that's what I'm doing so I'm going to give myself 20 minutes to make a game disclaimer this part get a little nerdy because I tried to tell you why I did in the script and how I did it first thing I did was create another a button where you click it and it opens the door to do this I get a part I click detector and then check if the player clicks if the player clicks they make the transparency 0.5 and can't Collide off then it waits 2 seconds before closing next I started scripting aart that rly changes colors I used math. random to get a random color out of the RGB so I don't have to put colors that I wanted to change to then I painted the parts around to look a disco party next I made a trap door again but this time I knew how to do a debounce so it looked better very go level one and two is done kill kill part does not work I'm going to quit bro script is way too easy I scripted the leader stats even though I know I'm not going to use it but I did it for the aesthetic yeah I know pretty cool we got boxes only reason I didn't use the leader stat is because I didn't know how to script part so when you touch it it adds one to your leader stat all right the 24 hours is done but in these 24 hours what did I learn I learn learning something new takes time and dedication you can't become a pro overnight but you still can learn a lot in 24 hours but don't expect to be a god once you learn something what do you guys want me to learn next let me know in the comments I you a part say you want me to go say you don't love no one say you don't love no more I'm not ready I'm so sorry know that it's better for you it is not better for me	8937	t	This content targets beginner Roblox developers by

P2ECl-mLmvY	The EASIEST Beginner Guide to Scripting (Roblox)	SmartyRBX	4300518	48:39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2ECl-mLmvY	roblox scripting tutorial	so you're opening up studio with a great game idea ready to make it quickly and hit the front page just to start building a map and realize you really don't know anything about how to get the game to actually work then maybe you searched up how to script on roblox tree now vacuum tree is you were extremely confused by all the bubbly jumbly mumbly jargon in all the videos and just ended up spamming your keyboard on your script before picking up a hammer smashing your computer and kicking your monitor in and slowly throwing your computer out a window and driving your car it's safe to say that might have been the last day for some of our computers but don't worry about it because i am here to help because i was in that tragic situation just a year ago but i managed to learn scripting eventually after starting as a builder and having barely any idea what i was doing just like you this guide is going to explain you how i learned a script in the simplest way possible and i can guarantee you'll be able to script by the end of this video you're going to need to open up roblox studio of course and we're going to make a base plate just a normal base plate and we're actually not going to make a script first we're actually going to build something for well we're just going to place one part down but it kind of counts so i'm just gonna delete the spawn location there let's close that tool box we aren't gonna be needing that for now so just click the part button up here and we're gonna scale this part up just a little bit and i'm gonna color it here so it's just a pink part and we're gonna name this part pink bark with a capital p on both of those word now so make sure to pause and bounce around this video by the way parts that you might have forgotten when you need them this is going to have a ton of chapters so you can bounce around the timeline it'll all be cut up to all the different definitions and everything so it's really helpful and useful for you now we're going to right click this part click insert object and we're going to add a script into this which is at the very top usually or you can just type in script you don't see it there now we're going to open up the script and now we're just going to delete everything that's here and we're going to type in local part equals script dot parent now the first thing we're looking at is variables and what we have just written out is a variable a variable just stores a value so the variable kink part stores the value script apparent which is well the parent is just whatever the script is inside of so that would be the pink part so that's what this variable equals this variable equals pink part by the way make sure that you write this exactly as i did a lot of things in scripting are very case sensitive so it's very important that you write this in how i wrote it with the uh uppercase and lowercase it all makes sense eventually but a value in a variable could be anything it could be an instance which is just a object in roblox studio like a part or gui you could also make it a line of text which is called a string in scripting or you could even make this equal to a number so now let's make a new part but wait do not close this script we're gonna make this part using scripting so what we've done is we've already made a part normally and we defined it through our script with a variable but now we want to create a part with our script so what we're going to write is local part equals instant.new which makes a new instance and then we're gonna type parentheses and we're gonna type in a quotation mark and then we're gonna start typing part and click enter now i'm gonna use my arrow key go out of that click enter all right remember case sensitive now this variable is telling the script to make a new part and we can basically make any kind of object in roblox studio with this too but this part doesn't know where to go right now aka what object it's going to be parented to and again the parent is just whatever it's inside of so right now we're going gonna parent this object this part to a different object in studio now right now the parent of the part is nothing and in scripting we write nothing as nil so part dot parent equals nil that's already what it's at so if we change it from nil or nothing to let's say game which is just the whole game that we're editing dot workspace so everything inside of the explorer here is in the game and inside the game is workspace at the very top which is where we see all our hearts so this part is going to go in a workspace and it's going to be visible in the game when we run the game it's not going to be visible until we start playing the game parent is actually just a property of an object in studio and a property is just one of these details on a different object in studio so it's like color shadow cast shadow color material material variant reflectance transparent these are all properties of a part so what we're going to do is we're going to change another property of this part so we're going to make a new line just by going to the end of this and clicking enter a few times and we're just going to write part dot transparency equals 0.5 remember to use that auto fill you can start typing something and just click enter and right like that it will build the rest of it in it's really useful make scripting a lot easier now let's go to the top of roblox studio and click the play button and let's test it out and there we go so we had a new part fall right here um this is a 0.5 transparency part and yeah it's a pretty cool example of how you can use scripting to make a part in studio all right so now we're going to stop the game we're going to go back congratulation on your first script now you can feel free to pause the video and mess around with any other properties you want with your script but right now we are going to be moving on to looking at boolean and booleans are basically any checkbox in studio is actually a boolean so as we can see here cache shadow which chooses whether or not this part has a shadow on it as you can see when we turn this off and on switches whether or not this has a shadow now actually what this means is hash shadow equals true so when it's checked cast shadow is true if cast shadow is unchecked i mean cast shadow is false that's just how we write it in the script so cast shadow true cast shadow falls so if we go ahead and make a new line and write heart dot cast shadow equals false then this part will not have a shadow if we change this to true it's going to have a shadow so we'll leave that at false and we can mess around with a few other properties so part dot anchor equals true if we do that then it means that this part is just it's not going to move or anything we're going to be able to push it around with our character probably already know what anchored means it's going to be stuck now one other thing we can do in studio is we can make the script wait so we could actually go up in the script a little bit and we can make the script wait to make an anchor so if we type in weight and then we type in a number and by the way numbers in studio do not have quotation marks but strings do strings are the lines of text numbers do not have quotation marks so just remember that whenever writing a number down you do not put quotation marks now this is going to wait five seconds before it makes the part anchor so all the other code before it is gonna run and then it's gonna start waiting for five seconds and it's gonna anchor the part now this is a little bit more advanced but to make this a little bit better for your performance on your game there's actually a new feature in studio that's called task.wait and you'll usually want to use task.wait if you aren't doing something that needs to be very exact weight makes it exact and it forces the game to wait that long but task.weight basically will let the game work at its own pace it just might be like 0.001 seconds off i usually tend to do test out weight when i can because it's just a little bit faster alright so now most tutorials would have actually shown you this first but let's take a little bit more of a look at strings so something that you can do with strings is print a line of words in the output which is a window that spits out warnings errors and prints from your scripts and roblox studio itself so if we go ahead and type in print and then we add parentheses and then we can type in a quotation mark and this is going to make a string for us so we can go ahead and write hi and then when we run the game by going to test and click on this drop down on play and go to run now in the output of studio after five seconds the weight in our script it's gonna say hi down here now that's pretty cool and we can also print numbers so we go ahead and print five the same thing will happen this will work just fine and by the way you can put numbers in strings so if we said high five this is still going to work when you're writing a number by itself you don't put quotation now this is mostly useful for when you're trying to debug your code and you want to mark where certain things happen so like after the part is anchored we could put a print and we can say part anchored now every time that happens we'll know the part was anchored and if we do not see this in there we'll know that for some reason maybe there is an error in our code the part did not get anchored and that's what you're going to be using print for most of the time now in scripts we can also do math and we can print numbers and strings in the output and we can also print math in the output so we can actually print three plus three let's see what happens when we press run on so after five seconds again after our weight is over that's going to do this see it prints out six three plus three equals six so it's going to print that out now make sure you do not put quotations around this just like i said because we are writing a normal number here and this is not a string and it's really important that you don't do that when you're doing math we can do a lot of other things uh we can also do multiplication and to do that we can just do a asterisk or a star little star it should be on the 8 on your keyboard you just hold shift and press eight and you'll get that star and if you do three times three well it's gonna print out nine and we can do this with the division as well so if we change the star to a slash it'll divide three by three and we'll get one and there's a lot of other cool things that you can do in math in roblox studio but we're gonna get back to this later because now it is time to move up to the next level this is where things start to get intense well not really just focus and follow along this is where you're gonna be able to start making things really work in your game and it's going to be incredible so make sure you do not click off if you want to become a scripter i see that mouse of yours inching closer and closer to the youtube homepage don't do it don't give up on your dream being able to script your own game because this is well worth it and it could end up being a real money maker for you later now we're on to function functions are exactly what they're called so i'm going to go ahead and just click control a and delete everything so we can start with a fresh slate basically functions are just a piece of code that performs a function now and this is just an action in your code and it's when you call upon it so basically we don't want to be sitting there just typing the same code over and over and over and over and over again so that's where functions come in and they have a few other cool things you can use them for too functions can be called upon with just a single word and it will run your entire function your entire chunk of code that's in that function without having to rewrite it or anything all you need to do is call the function by writing its name and parentheses after it but there's also another neat feature let's say you put something into a function well you can actually put a value into a function and it can spit something back so you can have a function that adds two to whatever the first parameter or input in the function is and it will go ahead and print that so it'll add two to whatever you put into it and it'll print it a parameter is basically just a variable when you're using it in your function and trust me this is going to be a lot more useful later and it's also going to make a lot more sense when we actually write this out so don't worry we're going to make a function right now so let's go ahead and write function add 10 x so x is going to be our first parameter so that's what you're going to do when you call the function you're going to input x which will be whatever number that you want to add 10 to we're going to go ahead and add parentheses to that and type x again and we're going to click enter and we're going to write local y equals x plus 10. so what this does is this makes a variable y which equals our input x plus 10. that's what it's doing so it's making a variable y and it just adds 10 to that and that's what y equals y is just x plus 10. now what we're going to do is we're going to print y so this is going to print x plus 10. so if x equals 2 and we add 10 to it that's going to be 12. so what y is going to be is 12 and it's going to go ahead and print that and then what we're going to do is we're going to return y and what this will do is it's going to basically wherever we call the function we're going to be able to use y later in the script also what i did right here is i wrote a comment you just put two dashes and you can write whatever you want and the script is going to ignore this you can write notes and it's pretty good practice to just write these wherever you can so you remember what things do in your script and also it helps if someone else is going to be looking at your script later down the line so functions are one of the most powerful things in scripting and one of the most important pieces of functions is called scope and you might have noticed so far that i write local before basically all variables well you can also write local before functions and if you don't write local that means it's naturally a global function so a global function can be used throughout the whole script no matter where it's written a local function can only be used after it's been written or if it's ins if it's inside of a function you can only use it inside that function so we can only use y here inside this function unless we return it and also if we write a local function at the end of the script for example we can't use it anywhere at all same for functions if you wrote a local function at the end of a script you could not use that function anywhere unless you change it to a global function so this is going to be a lot easier to understand after we practice a little bit more so if we want to go ahead and use this function that we've written here we can actually type in add 10 and we can type in right here in our x value so let's write 2 so what it's going to do is it's going to print 10 plus 2 which is 12 and it's going to return that for us so we can actually write local number equals add 10 to and what this is going to do since we returned y this is going to equal y this variable will equal 12 and we can go ahead and use that throughout the rest of our script which is why this is so useful especially when you get into the more advanced sides of scripting so hopefully you understand functions but if you don't don't worry we're going to get a lot more practice in after this this is just a brief explanation and again feel free to rewind re-watch any parts of this video that you need and remember do not give up you are well on your way to becoming a grit scripter and don't worry if you don't understand everything yet this video will clear up all your questions by the end so next thing we're going to do is we're going to look at if statement if statements basically check if something is true and if it is it does it so okay so we need a variable for this part so local part equals script dot parent which is our pink part so local part equals script.parent and what we're gonna do is we're gonna do if part dot anchored equals equals equals equals basically just means that it's checking if something is true you need to do that whenever you're checking if something is true if part.anchored equals equals true then part.color equals color three dot from rgb 255 zero zero so what this is gonna do this is just uh color three is just a three number value that that makes a color and if it's from rgb it's gonna be making it in red green and blue and the highest number being 255 lowest being zero so if we write 255 on the red it's going to be a fully red color if we were to add a hundred of this it'll make it a little bit pink since we're adding a lot of blue if we added a lot more like 220 it'll make it more purple since red and blue usually makes purple all right so what this is doing is it's checking if the part is anchored and if it is it's changing the color of the part to red now we can also add to this and we can make it check for something else so if this is not true it's just going to skip the changing of the color of the part altogether but we can make this move on and say else so if that isn't true it's going to move on and it's going to say print heart is on anchor so it's going to print that the part is unanchored so if it's anchored it's going to make the part red otherwise it's going to print part is on anchor and honestly this is one of the most useful things i use all the time in scripting because there's a lot of times we need to check things are true check if things aren't true check if things exist at all in your game and we don't have to just check if something is true we can actually check if part dot color if part.brickcolor equals brickcolor.new and then oh yeah we got to do the double equal signs i'm forgetting too it's easy to forget if part.brickcolor equals medium stone gray then we can print this is a gray part and this is going to write in the output that this is a gray part as you can see this doesn't even have to be a whether or not this is true because obviously we can't have it if heart.brick color equals equals true but if the parked up brick color equals brickcolor.new medium stone gray then it's going to print that this is a gray part and otherwise it's just going to skip over that code just like all if statements now there's also elsif statement so what we've looked at so far is if statements with check if something's true and if it is it does it we looked at else statement which it's just moves on so basically if that isn't true it'll move on it'll do whatever else is in the script but what else if does it's like else but then you're also checking for something else so if part dot anchored equals equals false then it's going to print part is unanchored so this already it does the same thing but it's checking for something specific so if we did this on something a little bit better of an example is doing it on the brick color so else if part dot brick color equals equals brick color dot new re really red it's going to check if this is medium stone gray and if it's not it's also going to go and check if the parts color is really red and it's going to print in the output this is a really red part so as you can see this can be very useful so if part.brickcolor equals equals recolor.new medium sewn gray then it'll print this is a gray part otherwise it's going to check if this is a really red part and if it is it's going to print this is a really red part otherwise it's going to skip both of these things all together and that is why else if statements else statements and if statements are all just as useful there's just different scenarios when you're going to need to use them when you need specific things done in your script so now we are just going to completely ditch this script for now i'm going to close it out and i don't want the script doing anything for now i don't want to delete it though so right right now i'm just going to actually uh right click rename this script to not not using this lol and i'm just going to click disable in property so the script is not going to do anything and we're going to make a new script by right clicking this part clicking insert object and clicking script and it's going to go ahead and make a new script so let's clear out the script by clicking control a and just clicking backspace and we're going to write if script dot parent dot name equals equals taco then print taco elsif script dot parent dot name equals equals hamburger then we're gonna print hamburger so what this is gonna do is this is another if and else if statement and this is going to check if the parts name is taco and if so it is going to print taco if it is not taco it is then going to check if this is a part named hamburger otherwise if it is not named hamburger it's going to do nothing if it is it's going to print hamburger else will always do something if the first if statement is not true else is always going to do something so if we do else it's going to print hamburger no matter what no matter what the name of the part is if it isn't taco it's always going to print hammer but if we add on that elsif it's going to be checking for something specific and it's going to print hamburger only if the parts name is hamburger so hopefully that clears up the difference between else and elsif i know it's kind of hard to get at first but it's very important that you know the difference because you're going to be using both of these a lot in script all right we're done with that enough with the else and elsif so next are events and events are really cool events are really interesting because we can finally start to check and like listen for when things are happening in our game and we get to have script that run when something happens in your game so let's say a player touches a part we can have an event of when a player touches a part we can run a chunk of code when that part is touched so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and make a new new part we're going to make a kill brick over here so i'm going to go ahead and add a part anchor that thing scale it and let's i'm going to make this you know a nice little red and we're going to add a neon to that nice little kilbray cool looking i want to turn off cast shadow on that too just for the heck of it and i'm going to click the plus on the part and i'm just going to add a script into this by clicking on it and i'm going to clear the script out by clicking ctrl a clicking backspace as usual and i'm also going to name this script i want to name this kill part script so first we're going to define our variables and we're going to write localkillbrick equals script.parent so what we're going to do is we're going to add an event that basically it's gonna check when some other part touches this part and then we're gonna check if that part is inside of a player's character we're basically gonna check and listen for when a player touches this part and then we're gonna go ahead and kill that player's character so we're gonna go ahead and do that so we're gonna listen for the touch event and we are going to make a function that passes on the touch part which is the part that touched the part and we're going to write that as a parameter the touch part parameter is going to pass on to the function and it's going to tell our script the exact part that touches so we're going to go ahead and make this function so kill brick dot touch which is the touched event and we're going to write a colon connect click enter and we're going to type in function and then add parentheses touch part and going to go to the end of this we're going to go to the right in between these two parentheses and we're just going to click enter there i'm going to click enter three times just so i have some space and so what this is going to do is as i said it's going to listen for the touch event pass on the touch part parameter to this function so we know what part touched this part and it's gonna tell our script the exact part that touched it and now we're gonna do the killing of the humanoid so we're gonna do local humanoid equals hutch part dot parent so whatever the touch part is inside of and we're going to do colon find first child and find for style is a built-in function in roblox studio which we can run on any object inside of the game and it will basically just loop through and check each child of an object in studio and it will check whether or not an object with a specific name is inside of that part so it's going to find a child with a specific name so we're going to find the child called humanoid and a humanoid is what controls all the aspects of a character like its health how high it can jump how fast it can walk everything like that and what it's gonna do is it's gonna see if we have a humanoid and if it does it is going to say okay here's the humanoid and this variable is going to equal humanoid if there is not a humanoid this is going to equal nil so what we're going to do now is we're going to check if there's a humanoid so we don't get an error if we don't check if there's a humanoid and there doesn't end up being a humanoid for whatever reason like if let's say a part that wasn't a character touch this part that part isn't gonna have a humanoid if it touches it it's gonna error out if we don't have this if so that's why we're doing fine first child it checks if there's a humanoid and now we're gonna do an if if humanoid it's all it is if there's a humanoid and basically by the way nil and false are the same thing writing nil if nil that's just like writing false so it falls basically so if this is nil it is going to not run this code but if there is a humanoid it's going to run it so hope that makes sense so if humanoid then humanoid.health equals zero and that's it so we're going to go ahead and play the game and let's hope this works so i'm going to go back to my baseplate click i have play here pinned up here um and we click play here so i play right on it and when i touch this part it is going to kill my character there we go so we have a perfect aubie kill brick all made for our game here that we're making and by the way by the end of this video you're gonna know how to make an obby did i mention that we're gonna be making a hobby yup you're gonna be making a game in this first video you're gonna be scripting your first game it's amazing i don't want to get too cocky but i'm gonna say this might be one of the best scripting videos out there because i'm gonna condense all the information into one video and hopefully you will be a scripting pro by the end of this video that is my goal so that was pretty easy right now a lot of things in studio built-in event so i'm gonna open my script back up and these built-in events we can actually see them with the object browser in a nice list so if we go to view object browser this will open up a new window and we can flip around these and this will basically show all the objects in roblox studio and everything that exists so if we choose if we can find part in here now i wish there was a search on this that's the only thing there's part okay if we find part in here we can actually see so in here the lightning bolts are the all the events on the part so we can listen for all of these events not just touch we can listen for touch ended so when something stops touching it or when the part is getting destroyed when a child's added when a property is changed there's all kinds of events on different objects in studio and every object in studio has tons of different events that are unique to it so there's a lot of cool things we can do with events and it doesn't just have to be touched we could listen to any event we want so we could say touch ended and when something stops touching it's gonna check if that part has a humanoid and it's gonna kill it too now i'm not sure if this always works i don't think this is that reliable but again there are there are ways that you can do that that's just an example there are a lot of events and we can we can use these for a lot of things by the way quick reminder you are doing great you are getting really close to becoming a full-on scripter and you got to keep going do not give up so we're getting on to the next detail which is random numbers random numbers i mean they're self-explanatory but they're really useful for a lot of things and especially for waiting a random amount of time so for example if we want to wait a certain amount of time after the player touches this part to kill them we can do of course task dot wait just so we have that good performance benefit of using task.weight versus weight and then we can just do math dot random and then add parentheses then what you do is you write the minimum number here so let's do task.weightmath.random one second and then comma 10 seconds so what this will do is it'll pick a random number between 1 and 10 seconds all right so after this i want to take a look at loops loops basically just let you repeat things forever or for a certain amount of time or until something is true there's a lot of ways that you can write loops so one way is a for loop so for let's go ahead and make a new script i'm going to make a new part anchor that and then i'm going to hit the plus add a new script so the for loop as i said so the for loop is it will loop through a number or a table so it will count up from one to that number if we do four number equals ten so it's going to count up to ten repeat basically i'll just repeat this ten times for number equals ten comma one do for number equals ten comma one comma one do script dot parent dot size dot x equals script dot parent dot size dot x plus one so what this is gonna do is it's gonna add one stud to the x size on the part ten times and i'm just gonna add a short weight between that so weight zero point uh let's do weight zero point five oh test.wait don't forget that and we can go ahead and test this out oh actually you have to do number equals 1 comma 10. i was wrong um it's the other way around and we don't need that third one but if we go ahead and test this it should work now oh another mistake i keep making mistakes i know the problem script.parent.size we need to make this a vector3 so vector3 as i said earlier a vector3 is just a three number value used to show usually positions with parts or sizes vector3 dot new and then just add parentheses around that and then the first values x then we're just going to do y uh we'll just copy this script.parent.size.x and change that to y same thing except we're putting z on the last one and now it should work finally worked out all the bugs and as we can see it's working now it looks like uh i made my weight a little bit too short but as you can see it added a lot of studs to each side and it definitely grew by ten studs so that's how four loops work in the most basic way with numbers for loops can also loop through a table and um so for example we can do four game get service players get players for i comma v in pairs so what this will do if we write this for i comma v in pairs parentheses game get service players get players what it will do is it will get the players from the player's service on roblox and it will loop through each player and we can do whatever we want to this so what v does is it will that will equal the current player that we're on and i is the table the table is just the list of all the players we've gotten from the player's service so if we say vita character destroy now this probably isn't going to work since we do have to wait for the uh for the character so if we do v wait for child character or if we do v dot character added v character added connect function so what this will do is it'll destroy the character every time it spawns now obviously we don't want this but as you can see this can be very useful to be able to loop through a list of things especially players like when you're making a mini game system you might need this or a lobby system it comes in handy a lot so we definitely recommend practicing this so that you can use it when you need it because trust me this is definitely something i use constantly i make hundreds of these every time i every time i script it seems like so you're definitely going to want to know these now next we have well loops and with well loops we can just do well something is true do something so we could say well script dot parent dot anchor equals equals true do as long as this part is anchored it uh it'll repeat this and it'll stop when the part is unanchored now a lot of people will just use well loops for uh looping forever so well true do so basically this will just make it repeat forever because true is well it's always going to be true and it's checking if whatever this is is true it's a little bit hard to explain but basically it just means it's checking if true is true and yeah true is true it's always going to be looping so you can have this loop forever now whenever you do one of these i do recommend always having a weight of at least uh nothing so if you do that it'll do the shortest possible amount of time that it can wait and you need this otherwise roblox studio can crash so or your roblox game might crash too if you have a loop and you want to keep these down and you definitely want to be careful with these because they can cause a lot of lag especially if you don't have that weight in there if we ever want a well true do loop to stop we can actually add break and what break will do is it'll just stop it and it'll continue on with all the code in front of it now we probably do want to practice this um welter do loop if you don't want to practice this uh you can always skip ahead to the next chapter on the video timeline but this will be really quick so we're just gonna make hearts rain out of the sky so local part equals instance dot new parentheses part part dot parent equals game dot workspace local random x equals math dot random negative 200 comma 200 and then local random z equals math dot random negative 200 200 and then we'll do throw all those positions together into part dot position equals vector three dot new random x comma let's say 50 studs in the sky and random z pass dot wait dude let's just do the shortest one let's see how laggy this is gonna be like a lag test on my computer here um let's go ahead and play this and as we can see parts are raining out of the sky so that was a mission successful and that is one cool example of how you can make welter do loops and use them effectively in your game um yeah now i promise we are almost done with the math almost but i need to give you guys an example for how to use a break so we probably want this to stop running parts at some point otherwise our computer is going to absolutely crash um well first we probably want to add debris basically what this does it'll automatically make the part delete itself after a certain amount of time so let's look at debris service up here so debris is a service local debris equals game get service debris and what we'll do is we'll get debris and then add item part lifetime so what this is is we'll just make this last um let's say 20 seconds for each part and now what we want to do is we want to make this break if there's 400 total parts in workspace so so what we want to do is we can actually just add a part count we want to do that outside the loop local part count equals zero and then we'll do part count equals part count plus one and if part count is greater than or equal to 400 then break we probably want to put this at the top here all right so next are tables which you might have seen that you've probably seen these before visually or in a school document but these actually can be made in scripting too but they're quite a bit different but it's actually pretty similar to a table on a document if you want to look at it that way you'll see it has rows and columns and this is very similar to how tables work on roblox scripting we use them to store large amounts of data and then loop through them very quickly with for loops which i just showed you and they're extremely useful they come in pairs so if we look at a visual table we can see that there's a row and then we could have a number right next to it and there could be a value in the next column over this is called a key value pair a key being the row number or the row name and the value is just whatever piece of data that could be a string a number a picture whatever whatever piece of data is associated with the key also the key doesn't have to be a number neither does the value as i said so let's go ahead and delete this you don't have to you can just make a new script but i'm going to delete mine and let's make a new table with a variable so local we'll make a fruit table so local fruit equals and then what we do is we hold shift and then right above the normal brackets like these right above that if we hold shift we'll get these this gives you a table bracket so just go ahead and click enter a couple times okay so the first uh key will be bananas equals one and then you add a comma or you can do a semicolon after that so what we've written here is that there are there's one banana so if we go ahead and reference this table later we see oh hey table how many bananas are there it's gonna save one it's gonna return one so next we'll do apples equals five oranges equals two and that's it so the keys in this table are the names of the fruit and it equals that number of fruit there are so there's one banana five apples two oranges and to access one of the values in the table we just write fruit at these kinds of brackets and then we can write whatever name whatever name of fruit we want which would be our key bananas equals fruit bananas and then we add we can add five to that so what this does oh we do need to add quotations around this i almost forgot because it is searching the table for that so this is just like find first child which loops through a parts children but this rather than looping through a part it can loop through a data set like a table this is really just dipping our toes in tables and there's a lot more we can do we can loop through a table with an in pairs loop and check for a certain value like i showed earlier and find first child is a built-in function a roblox studio that actually loops through every child or part inside of another part and it searches for one with the same name that you input into it everything in studio is made up of tables literally everything like the children of every part which are just the items inside a part even the properties of parts are pretty much in tables this is why tables are extremely important in scripting on roblox or not so with that in mind we can actually look through the children of a part with the get children function which returns all the children of the part in a table for us so let's first find some stuff we want to remove let's first add some stuff that we can remove so let's add a bunch of particles to this uh part here let's pour a part we're going to add a particle emitter i'm just gonna duplic duplicate that a million times and i'm gonna go ahead and delete everything we did here and let's do a four iv in pairs loop looping through all the children of this part and we're gonna see we're gonna check if each object is a particle and if it is we're going to destroy it it's going to be gone so for i comma v in pairs script dot parent get children do if v is a particle emitter then v destroy the reason why we want to check if it's a particle emitter with is a is because we don't want to accidentally delete the script that would screw some stuff up so we want to make sure that we're checking if each thing is a particle emitter if you want to check if something is apart for example which you're going to need you can actually just check if it is a base part and that will check if it is a part of any kind it could be a mesh part wedge doesn't matter it could be a normal part it will make sure that it is a part of some sort and it helps because you don't have to check for each kind of part you just check for base part just need to throw that in so i'm going to leave it as particle emitter and let's go ahead and play oh that's a lot of particles we definitely need to get rid of those so if we play the game and if they're all gone we'll know it works and as we can see it's perfect no more particles it worked perfectly so this is definitely one of the things i'm used the most in scripting constantly i can't emphasize enough this is one of the most important things you're going to want to practice this a lot you're almost there you are almost a scripter do not quit now if you click up the video you're probably going to forget everything really really quickly so we got to practice right now let's practice by making a quick obby so an ob is a good practice because we can just make a bunch of obstacles do whatever we want with that and we already made the billbricks so why not use that as our first obstacle so we have this component so i'm going to go ahead and start building an obby so we can just add this in there scale it up um and let's anchor this make it a little bit darker and let's raise this up and uh i'm gonna turn on my increment to one stud and then i'm just gonna duplicate it a couple times and there we go so i want to go ahead and make sure we're organized by oh this is way uneven there we go so let's go ahead and make sure this is organized by adding a folder in the workspace and i'm going to rename this to kill part and just drag them all in there and there we go so oh this isn't the kill part put that back in the workspace so now we do have a problem we have all these kill part scripts inside of each one of these parts this is a kind of redundant so what we're going to do is let's delete all of these by selecting them all clicking select ultron and then just hitting backspace and deleting them all except for one and i'm going to move this into server script service and in this i'm just going to change a couple things so let's change kill brick to kill bricks folder let's change the variable to reference the folder so what i'm getting at here is that we're going to use a for loop to loop through each part and make it so whenever that part is touched it will kill the character so game.workspace.killpark and then we're gonna do our for loop so for underscore comma v in pairs kill bricks folder get children and then arrow key out of that do and then let's just uh select all this hit control x and paste that in there and let's just change v we can just change v to kill bricks underscore will just mean that it isn't counting like how how many kill bricks we've already looped through it just won't save that table it it's just a little bit better on performance to do that if you don't need that number like sometimes you might want to check which kill brick you're on for example and if it's on the fifth kill brick maybe you want it to stop or something well we don't need that right now so that's why i did that better for performance so we changed v to kill brick and v v is just the item we're on currently in the table so right now it'll be the current kill brick and replacing that in this script should work perfectly and we should delete our little practice weight there if we have that still and there we go so now our kill parts will work and now maybe we should make some checkpoints so let's go ahead and make a new checkpoints folder and rename that to checkpoints and let's go ahead and add a part oh yeah before we do anything else let's make sure they're all anchored and i'm going to go ahead and scale this down as you guys can see i'm probably not the best at building hobbies but there we go um let's honestly make this neon and then i'm going to make this like white yeah there we go i don't want too much glow on it so i think smokey grey looks like a great color and next we'll start scripting this so uh let's add a new script into server script service and let's rename it to checkpoint script checkpoints script and we're gonna do the same thing as we did before so local check checkpoints folder equals game.workspace.checkpoint and for underscore comma v in pairs checkpoints folder get children do if v is a base part well it checks if it's a part of any kind then v dot touch connect function and now we need this to do something so let's define that player real quick so we're gonna do connect function part okay we'll do part and then if part dot aaron here let's go ahead and add the player servers because we do need to check if this is a player so local players equals game get service players and we'll do it if players get player from character part dot parent so i'll check if the model that the part is in is a player oh actually i keep changing things but we're gonna cut this select it hit control x and let's do local player equals just a little bit better so we don't have to do it again so if player then what we're going to do is we're going to add a stage to that player and we're going to check if they haven't already touched that checkpoint or we're going to set it to that number of checkpoint so what we want to do is drag our checkpoint in here and we're going to rename this to one so we'll just have the checkpoint number be uh the name of the part now we do need to set up a leaderboard real quick so this will be really easy so we're gonna do is we're gonna make a leader stats it's gonna save what stage they're on while they're in game it'll reset when they leave but this will make it so that when you join the game it's going to make you a stage number so local leader stats oh wait no gate players dot player so players dot player added connect function player local leader stats equals instance dot new folder uh leader stats dot parent equals player local stage equals instance dot new int value so let's make a new integer value which is just a number no decimal and it will save what stage it's on and we're going to put that in leader stats so it'll show on the leaderboard as a stage and then the number so stage dot parent equals leader stats and that's all that's needed so if player if player and let's make a variable for their stage so local stage value equals player.leaderstash.stage if player and stage value is less than two number so two number will make this to a number v dot name so that'll check so the the name of the checkpoint and that'll get the number the name of the checkpoint will turn into a number and it will check if the player is not on a stage that is greater than that so we don't want them going back stages that's basically all this does and it'll set the stage value oh yeah we do need to do stage value dot value because stage value is a object it's the uh in value we have to do the dot value because it's a property so stage value dot value equals v name okay that was a lot if you did not catch it feel free to rewind and feel free to copy down pause and copy down what i have um if you missed it this should set up our checkpoint in our game so if we go ahead and play right here oh we didn't name the folders here we have a little problem we did not name the folders leaderstats.name equals leader stats and stage dot name equals stage there we go another error i didn't capitalize that oops this is the hardest part about scripting most annoying part there's a lot of bug fixing and little annoying things like that like one one capitalization can screw up your whole script it gets annoying but there we go finally it works so we touch this and now we have we're at stage one we die when we touch a kill brick and that is good we do want to make sure that we move the character to the checkpoint when they respawn so if we do player.character added connect function character or just you char local checkpoint equals checkpoints folder find first child do stage.value so if it finds the stage value in the checkmates folder it's basically checking if their current stage even exists then we're going to do player dot primary part and what this does is it'll get the human android right the humanoid root part stumbling over my words humanoid root parts or the torso if using r6 and it will move to where we want it so player player.primarypart.c frame equals so c frame is just the way we do positions and rotations all in one nice value in roblox studio it's kind of weird and complex i mean i don't even completely understand it's a very complex subject um c frame but with the c frame we're just going to go ahead and write c frame dot new check point dot c frame dot rotation equals dot c frame dot okay okay check point dot primary part dot c frame dot position dot y plus five so we're adding five studs so they spawn above it i'm making this way too complicated aren't i checkpoints dots okay let's hope this works a few moments later and of course it didn't work oh okay part.c frame no that needs to be player.character dot c frame i screwed a lot of things up here i'll be honest with you guys i don't know how how to make this respawn right but i think you guys get the point of the obby i don't like making hobbies when in doubt go to the dev hub on roadblocks it's a great time for me to do it but you can go to the dev hub so you search for roblox dev hub developer.roblox.com when you go to this you can find info on everything and when you can you want to go from here or sometimes when you google a question uh you can find a question answered on dev forum or scripting helpers but usually you're going to end up back here so you want to try and read this when you can learn some stuff about scripting and if you want more advice on how to get commissions on roblox and how you can earn tons of robux from scripting or whatever you'd

KuJyYmdhu7E	How To Script In ROBLOX Studio! (EASIEST Beginner Scripting Tutorial)	RoDev	484962	42:14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuJyYmdhu7E	roblox scripting tutorial	I can guarantee you'll be able to Script by the end of this video! This guide covers all of the Scripting essentials, and you can always come back to this video, whenever you need it. Feel free to jump around using the chapters (timestamps in description, too.) Let's get started! The very first thing you wanna do is go to "Roblox.com/create" Once you're on this website, download Studio by pressing the "Start Creating" button. Once you've downloaded Roblox Studio, it's going to open up, just like this. Once it's downloaded and open, you will need to sign in. After that, create a brand new "Baseplate". Once you've created a brand new Baseplate, close all the tabs that you don't need. Make sure to have the "Explorer", "Properties", and "Output" windows open. In the "View" tab at the top of the screen, you can open these windows. I have my "Explorer", "Properties", and "Output" windows open. First, delete the spawnpoint, then create a "Part". To do this, press the plus button on the "Workspace", then click on "Part". This spawns in a little Part for us. Go to the "Home" tab and select the "Scale" tool to change the Part's size. If you were watching closely you can see in the “Properties” that the “Size” property has changed. If you look at some other properties, you can see what the “BrickColor” is, if it’s casting a shadow, what the “Material” is, and the “Transparency”. If you’d like, you can go ahead and mess around with these properties a little bit. As you can see, when I move the “Transparency”, it makes it more transparent. When you change the “Material”, it changes what the Part looks like. For now, I’m going to keep the default settings and create a brand new “Script”. Let’s create a “Script” inside of the “ServerScriptService”. Click the plus next to “ServerScriptService”, then create a “Script”. Make sure it is NOT a “ModuleScript” or a “LocalScript”. Make sure it is a normal “Script”. When you create your Script, you are going to see: print(”Hello world!”) This is what we call a “Print Statement”. Now that you’ve created your Script, you’ll see it in the “ServerScriptService”. All these things like the “Baseplate”, “Part”, and “Script” are called “Objects”. Even this “Texture” right here is an Object in the “Explorer”. If your Script isn’t open, double-click on it to open it up. Next, let’s look at Printing. Printing is one of the most basic concepts in Scripting. As you can see, it says: print(”Hello world!”) This “Hello world!” is inside these two quotation marks. Whenever something is inside two quotation marks, it’s a “String”, as it says right here. This right here is considered a “String”, because it is a piece of text. If you run your game right now, it will say “Hello world!” inside the Output. To run the game, click on the arrow (below “Play”) and click on “Run”. This will run all the Scripts without actually spawning you in. As you can see, it says “Hello world!” right here, and it tells me where it came from. If I click on the Script button right here, it brings me to the Script that printed “Hello world!” In addition to that, it also shows me what line it was printed on. This is helpful when you have a really complex Script and you’re trying to debug your code. For example, if your code is stopping somewhere, and it’s not telling you where it’s stopping, you can place Print Statements in the code to find out where the code stopped working. Next, let’s look at Data Types. There are a few Data Types I want to go over. The first one is a “String”. This is a really simple string right here. Inside two quotation marks, you write some text. That’s pretty much all there is to Strings. Another Data Type is “Number”. Numbers don’t go inside quotation marks. This is because they aren’t Strings. Any number I type in here will be printed when I run the game. As you can see, as I type this number in, it’s printed in the Output. There are a few more Data Types, however, the last one I wanna look at right now is a “Boolean”. Whenever you see these check boxes in the “Properties” window, these are “Boolean” values. For example, if I go to the Part and I enable “CastShadow”, there will be a check mark (which means it’s turned on). When I disable it, there is no check mark. This means, when I click on it and there’s a check mark, I just set the “CastShadow” property to “true”. And that is what Scripting really is. Scripting is basically changing different Properties at different times. Now, let’s rename this Part. Inside the “Properties” window, look for “Name”, then change it to “BluePart”. Next, go to the “BrickColor” property, click on it, then change the BrickColor. I’m gonna change it to the “Electric blue” color. Now you can go back to the Script by clicking on it (at the top of the screen) or double-clicking it in the “ServerScriptService”. Here, we can change the same properties. To do this, type: game.Workspace (Which means you’re going from the “Game”, which is everything then ‘selecting’ the “Workspace”, and then “BluePart” to ‘select’ the Part.) Current code: game.Workspace.BluePart “Lua” is a case-sensitive language. That means, all of these capital letters NEED to be capitalized. If I were to type this with a lowercase letter “b”, it’s not going to work because the actual name of the Part has a capital letter “B” in it. Next, I’m going to type: .CastShadow = false This may be a bit confusing right now, But what I’m doing is setting the “CastShadow” property to “false”. If you remembered what I just said, that means when you click on this Part, and look at “CastShadow”, this checkmark will not be there. Let’s go ahead and run the game to see if the code works. When we click on the Part, we can see that the “CastShadow” property does not have a check mark. This means that “CastShadow” is set to “false” (meaning it’s turned off), which is what the Script updated it to. Next, let’s learn about “Variables”. Before we learn how to create a “Variable”, The first thing I wanna show you guys is exactly why we use Variables. I’m going to change the “CastShadow”, “Transparency”, and “Material” properties of this Part. As you can see, the “Material” of this Part is “Leafy Grass”, the “Transparency” is 0.5, and the “CastShadow” property is “false”. I did this in the Script by typing these three lines of code. So remember, it goes: game.Workspace.BluePart.CastShadow And the same thing applies for the other lines of code. It goes through the whole Game, then we select the Workspace, then we select the “BluePart” inside of the Workspace, and then it’s going to look for either a “child” / object inside of the “BluePart”, or it’s going to look for a property of the object. Since there is a property called “Transparency”, it’s going to update its Transparency. The same thing with the Material, it went to the Part, and then it looked for the “Material” property. However, this is a lot of code to write out. Let me show you all why we use Variables. All I have to do is type: local part = game.Workspace.BluePart and then under here, all I have to do is type: part.CastShadow = false part.Transparency = 0.5 part.Material = “LeafyGrass” (or Enum.Material.LeafyGrass) Now I'm going to delete this code. And as you can see, this is a lot easier to write. The word “local” tells the Script that we are going to name a variable. I named my variable “part”. You can assign the variable to something by using the equals sign (=). I made sure that the “BluePart” in the Workspace “becomes” the Variable. The “BluePart” is another data type. It's called an Object (or “Instance”). On the first line of code, the Script “learns” what the “part” Variable is. It knows that out of the whole game, you go to “Workspace” and then you go to “BluePart”. From there, it knows what the “Part” Variable is talking about. After that, whenever you say “part” (the Variable name), it knows that the “BluePart” is what it's looking for. If we put “game.Workspace.BluePart” right over here, it will do the exact same thing. However, we are making it a lot easier by typing this line of code (the Variable), which tells the Script that all of this can just be replaced with “part”. If you remember when we talked about Data Types, one of the types we talked about was a “String”. The cool thing about Variables is that they can equal any Data Type. I named this variable “CoolString”, and I set the value to “Hello there!” I also made sure it's inside these quotation marks to make sure the Script knows it's a String. Without the quotation marks, the Script doesn't know what “Hello” or what “there!” means. However, inside the quotation marks, it knows it's a string. The cool thing about this is we can type the variable name inside the Print Statement and this will print “Hello there!” If I run the game right now, you'll see that it says “Hello there!” in the Output. I can click on it right here, and it also tells me the line number right here. It brings me right to where it printed from. Next, let's learn about how the Explorer works, and what Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is. By now, you know what an object is. These things inside the Explorer are called objects (or Instances), and they can have “Parents” and “Children”. A good way to explain this is to look at the “Camera”. This camera is a “child” of the Workspace, the Workspace is a “parent” of this “child”, and this “child” is the Camera. Once again, this Texture is a “child” of “Baseplate”. It is not a “child” of Workspace because its “parent” is the Baseplate. Baseplate’s “parent”, however, is the “Workspace”. You can tell what an object is parented to and what children it has by looking at the indentation. This folder right here is indented twice. Its parent is the Camera, not the Workspace. We'll learn about this later, but this folder right here is actually a “descendant” of the Workspace. It is not a “child” of the Workspace. However, we'll be learning about that later. The next thing we're going to be learning about are “Instances”. So far, you've learned about objects, printing, but now I want to make you all more comfortable with the Script editor. So go ahead and open up your Script, delete the code, and type this: Instance.new(”Part”) What this line of code does, is it creates a new object and that object is a “Part”. “Instance.new” will create the object, and inside the parentheses, you want to specify in a string, what you want to create. However, the issue is, when you run the game, you're not going to find this Part anywhere, and that's because its parent is currently “nil”. We see inside these objects that their Parent property are set to whatever they’re Parented to. For example, this Baseplate is parented to the Workspace. However, this Part has no parent right now. That means this Part's parent is “nil”. What we did here was add Instance.new(”Part”) to a variable. So now whenever we type “newPart”, it's going to be referencing this Part that we created. You never actually type “Instance.new()” by itself. You always make sure it's assigned to a Variable, so you can actually edit the instance that you created. When I say “edit the instance”, I mean changing its properties. For example, the first thing you do when you instance something new is you change its “Parent” property. Currently the parent is nil. That means you're not going to find it in the Explorer. It's currently parented to nothing. Let's go ahead and put this in the Workspace. To do that, let’s change “nil” to “game.Workspace” Now if you run your game, you're going to find the Part in the Workspace. As you can see, the Part is right here. Next, let's change its “Name” property. This is really simple to do and I know you all can do it with the knowledge that you've gained so far. Type: newPart.Name = And then now you need to type in a String. That's because the “Name” property is a String. I named it “CoolPartThatICreated”. Let's run the game to see if it worked. As you can see, the part's “Name” property has been set to “CoolPartThatICreated”, and that’s because of the Script. Now you may be wondering, “what else can I do with Instance.new?” “I don't just want to keep creating Parts.” Well, for that, you're going to need to look at the “Object Browser”. To open up the “Object Browser”, go to “View” and open it up from the left side. After future updates, it might not be here anymore. Just look around and you'll find it. The object browser is amazing! It contains everything you can really do in Scripting. For example, if I ever need to use “Sparkles”, I can find them here and it gives me a summary. It also tells me what it is (it's an Instance). In the top right, you'll find things we can do with the Sparkles. For example, in the Script, if we want to destroy some Sparkles, what we could do is destroy them using this Function “:Destroy()”. You'll learn how to do that later. Let's say I wanted to run some code when the Sparkles got destroyed. In the Object Browser, I can see that there's an “event” for when they get destroyed (”Destroying”). Basically, if there's an “event” for it, I can add code to that. That means that when the Sparkles are destroyed, this event will go off, which means I can run code. If that did not make any sense to you, don't worry. We're going to be learning about “events” in just a little bit. Right here, I found the part. If you scroll down to these blue blocks, you'll see all the properties that we've been looking at. For example, you can see the “BrickColor” and “Transparency”. The Object Browser is great because you can see all the events, Functions, and properties of every object in the game. This can be really helpful when you're Scripting or if you're stuck. And one more thing! If you don't know what something does, you can always find it in the Object Browser and read the summary. The next thing we're going to be learning about is Math. Math is really important because everything the computer reads is in numbers. For example, the “Color” is simply a number. “Position” and “Size” are also numbers. All the text, like the “Name” and the “Parent” become numbers when the computer reads them. It's really important to know Math when Scripting, so make sure you understand this next part. I'm going to remove all of this code and create a new Variable. I'm going to call this: local number = 5 Inside of a Print Statement, I'm going to write: print(1 + number) Let's go ahead and run the game. Obviously it's going to print “6”. This happened because we told the Script that “number” equals 5 and then we added 1 to “number”. The Script read this line of code just like this, except we saw it like this. This right here (+) is a plus sign. Let's try different operations, like subtraction. Running this code gives us -4 To divide in Scripting, use a slash (/) 1 / 5 equals 0.2, that’s why it gave us “0.2” To multiply, press “Shift” and press “8” that's going to give you a star. That will give you a star (*, an “asterisk”). 1 * 5 equals 5, which is why it gave us “5” Now that you know the four basic operations, I’ve listed out the operations here in case you need to see them. I know you guys understand Variables by now, so I'm going to stop using them and just do some math here. This code right here gave us 100 because 10 * 10 equals 100. However, if I were to use a slash, which is for division, it would give me “1” because 10 / 10 equals 1. There isn't much else to say here because basic math is really simple in Scripting. You have these four operations and you can do anything you want with the numbers. To wrap this section of the video up, I'm going to create a number using math and then apply that to the Part’s Transparency. In case you are still confused, I’m going to explain this one more time. When I write “game”, I'm referencing this entire game. All of these things right here are actually children of the game. From there, what I'm doing is “game.Workspace” because Workspace is a child of the game. The next thing I need to do is grab the “BluePart”, which is a child of the Workspace. We can also confirm this by looking in the properties of the “BluePart”. You can see that the parent is the Workspace. So I'm going to write “Workspace.BluePart”, and now we want to adjust the Transparency property. So I'm going to write “BluePart.Transparency”. By the way, you can also press “Tab” to autofill it. That just makes Scripting a little easier and faster. Now I'm going to use equals (=) because I want to set it to something. I'm going to write “newTransparency” because the Script knows that “newTransparency” equals 0.5 Let's run this and you'll see the Part’s Transparency is 0.5 That's about it for math. Let's go ahead and see how you can use “Print Statements” to find errors. Let's learn about the “Output”, errors, and how to counter or fix errors. By looking at the Script, it's pretty simple what it does. First we find out where the “BluePart” is and then we tell the Script that “part = game.Workspace.BluePart” Remember, we go to “game”, then “Workspace”, and then to the “BluePart”. From there we're looking at the Part’s Transparency. The Script sets it to 1, then 0.3, 5.6, and then we have a Print Statement. This will let us know that the Script made it to this line. If you didn't know what happens, when we have an error, the Script stops. From there, it's going to line #9, #10, and at line #11, there’s an error. From there, the Script will stop and this line will never run. To show you this, I'm just going to go ahead and run the game. As you can see, we did get an error here, but let's look at the Print Statements. The only Print Statement we can see is “Line 8”. Now, I do know it's showing us where the error is, and what line it occurred on, but sometimes, you won't see this. That's why it's important to know how to do this. So remember what the Print Statement says, stop the game, then look at your Script. As you can see, “Line 8” was printed right here, However, “Line 12” was never printed. In order to fix this error, for each individual line, I’ve added a Print Statement. After running the game, we can see “Line 8”, “Line 10”, and “Line 12”, but we don't see “Line 14”. This means, that inbetween line 12 and 14, the error occurred. That leaves line #13. As you can see, we found the error. From here, you would take a look to find out what's wrong. I spelled “Transparency” wrong and we're using a Data Type that won't work here. We need to use a Number instead of a String. And by the way, this won't even work as a String. It needs to be inside quotation marks “ ” Next, let's take a look at something really really useful... Functions! You’ve learned about Variables, but what if we could take it one step further and make all of this code easier to write? That's why we use “Functions”. This right here is a Function that I created. I named it “changeTransparency”. Inside of it is a “Code Block”, and right here, we can write any code we want. I'm going to write: part.Transparency = 1 Now you'll notice that if we run the game right now, nothing is actually going to happen to the part. As we can see, the part is still visible. So let me explain why that happened. So far, we've declared the Function. We told the Script to run the code inside the code block whenever we call the Function. This means we have to call the Function to run the code. To do that, type: changeTransparency() (What you named the Function) and then run the game. And just like that, the part is invisible. It's highlighted right now because I've selected it in the Explorer, but if I deselect it, it's invisible. Now you might be wondering, “Why don’t we just write this line of code again and again and again? It seems a lot simpler than having to write extra code to create a Function.” So let me show you guys why we actually use Functions. Let's learn about “Parameters”. Parameters are really really simple. I'm going to create an example and then explain how it works. I created a Parameter called “number” and I set the “Argument” to “1” when calling the Function. Let's run the game and you'll see that the part is invisible. The part is invisible, Now let's go and find out why / how Parameters work. Right here, I have a Parameter called “number”, and in the Script I can use “number” whenever I want. However, if I don’t tell the Script what number, it's never going to know what to set the Transparency to. That's why when you call the Function, you have to use an “Argument”. For my Argument I put “1”. This means, when the Script runs the code, it's going to go to the Function, which will make “number” equal 1. So when it runs the code, it's going to see the code just like this. It's not going to see the code like we see it. It'll see it with the 1. And that's because we provided the Argument “1”. We can take this one step further and add multiple Parameters. I'm going to call this Parameter “number1”, and this Parameter “number2”. I've changed the Function name to “addNumbers”. We don't need this Variable, so let's get rid of it. As you can see, I have “number1” and “number2”, and in the Function, I'm adding the numbers and printing them. If I were to run this code, it's going to print “3”. The Script added “1” and “2” together and it printed “3”. If you're following along, you'll know why this works. “number1” became “1” and “number2” became “2”. Then the Script added them together in the Function. Remember, these can be anything. So I can make this “67” and I can make this “5”. And when I run the game, it's going to add the two numbers together. It printed “72” because the Function added the numbers together. Now I'm going to show you a real example using multiple Parameters. Right here, I created two parts. This one is called “RedPart” and the other one is called “GreenPart”. Now let's say I wanted to change its Transparency. For this, I would create a brand new Function called: “ChangeTransparency”. Inside the Function I would add the code, but there's an issue! I only want to use one Function. However, if I want to adjust both parts, I would have to create multiple Functions. To combat this problem, we can create a Parameter for the part. Along with that, I created a Parameter for the Transparency. Now, all we have to do is type: part.Transparency = Transparency Below this Function, I'm going to call it. Let's put the “RedPart” in first, but before that, let’s create our Variables. local redPart = game.Workspace.RedPart local greenPart = game.Workspace.GreenPart After that, I'm going to input the “RedPart” as an Argument. If you haven't picked that up already, These are “Parameters” (in the parentheses of the function) When you input them (when calling the Function), they're called Arguments. I called the Function with the “redPart”, turning it into the “part” Parameter in the Function. As you can see right here, we set the Variable and the Transparency as “0.4”. Let's run the game and you'll see the “redPart” now has a Transparency value of 0.4. It's a little hard to see with the lighting, but if we look really closely, it is transparent. In the Properties, the Transparency is 0.4. Now I'm going to do the same thing for the “greenPart”. All I’ll do is change this to “greenPart”, and make this “0.9”. Let's go ahead and run the game. As you can see, the RedPart’s Transparency is 0.4 and the GreenPart’s Transparency is 0.9. This is one of the most basic ways I could explain Functions and Parameters. So if this is helping out so far, let me know by leaving a like on the video. Next, let's learn another feature of Functions, which is “Returning”. Like pretty much everything else in this video, “Returning” is very, very useful. Sometimes, Functions don't just change things in the game. Functions return values. This means you can use Functions to do something like math, and you can have the Function give the answer back. Let me show you what I mean. The code you can see right now prints “3”. It might not be obvious how it works right off the bat, but let's take a look. The first thing I'm doing is creating a Function. You already know how to do this. We have Parameters right here, and the Function will do something with the Parameters. In this case, we use “1” and “2”. That means “A” is 1 and “B” is 2. So the Function did what it did with the Arguments that we put in, and after that it did something new: It returned “x”. Remember, “x” can be anything. If this was “r”, it would be “r” here. And if this was “v”, it would be “v” right here. However, in this case, I used “x”. What's happening here, is the Function knows “a” is 1 and “b” is 2. (When I run it from here) What the Function is doing, is adding “1 + 2”, and then it's setting a Variable “x” to the answer of “1 + 2”, which is “3”. Then, the Function is returning “3”, and then the “addednumbers” Variable becomes “3” and we end up printing “3”. Essentially, what happened is this turned into “3” and then the game did what it did, knowing that “addednumbers” equals 3. If I were to change this to “4” and “5”, it would print “9”. Just like that, it printed “9”. Let's run through it once again. First, I'm setting up a Function, then I'm setting the Parameters “a” and “b”, we're adding the Parameters “a” and “b”, and we're setting that value (whatever “a + b” is) to the “x” Variable, and then the Function is returning “x”. That means this entire “Function call” turns into “x”. Now you might be wondering why “x” is underlined. Let's learn about “Scope”. To explain “Scope”, I'm going to be creating two Functions. I've set up two Functions. At the top, I defined “x” as “1”, and then for the first Function, I printed “x” as well as in the second Function. After that, I ran both of the Functions. We already know what this will do. It's going to print “1” twice. As you can see, the Script printed “1” twice (On line #4 and line #8) Looking back at the Script, on line #4 we printed “x” and on line #8, we also printed “x”. Now if I were to take this “local x = 1” and just move it into this Function right here, this “x” down here is actually underlined. If I run this, it's going to print “1” and “nil”. If you remember from earlier in the video, “nil” means “nothing”. It's the Script's way of saying, “I don't know what to put here” (or, “Variable x does not exist / have a value”) “I'm just going to put no value” along with that, before we run the Script, it's also telling us that it doesn't know what “x” means. So you might be wondering why this happens, because we did define “x” as “1”. For some reason, this Function is unable to pick that up. Well, “Scope” kind of works like this: Whatever happens inside this Function will stay in this Function, and that's because of the word “local”. We've been writing “local” this whole time, not really knowing what it means, but now we're learning about “Scope”, so let's dive into that. When I define “x” inside this Function, and the Script reaches line #5, it “deletes” (or “forgets”) what it learned inside line #2 and #3. When I define “x = 1” in the Script, using the “local” keyword, the Script “deletes” everything from inside this Function that it knows, by line #5. Once it reaches line #5, it doesn't know what happened on line #2 and #3. That's why when the Script reaches line #7, it doesn't know what “x” means. However, if I were to remove the “local” keyword, as you can see, the Script now knows what “x” means. If I run the game, it's going to print “1” twice. Just like that, the Script printed “1” twice. That's pretty much all there is to the basics of “Scope”. One more thing to mention, is that when you have a Variable at the top of your Script just like this, the entire Script can access that Variable. So it doesn't matter if it's local or not, the entire Script is able to access that Variable because it's not inside of a block of code, it's not inside of a Function, a loop, or an “if statement”. Speaking of “if statements”, let's go and learn about them. “If Statements” are very, very simple. Since Lua is written almost like English, it’s really easy to learn “If Statements”. For example, let me write one. This “If Statement” right here checks if “x” equals “1”, and then it prints “X is equal to one!!” When I run the game, in the Output we see “X is equal to one!!” However, as you might have guessed, if I change this to “2” and run the game, it's not going to print that. Stating the obvious, the reason for this is because Variable “x” is equal to “1”. Here, we're only running this code if “x” is equal to “2”. One more thing you may have pointed out is that there are two equal signs here (==) The reason for this is we are doing a “check”. When we're setting a Variable to something, use one equal sign (=). For example, I'm telling the Script right here, “x = 1” However, over here, I want to check what the value of “x” is. So what I'm doing, is: “if x ==”, and then what I want to check for. In this case, I'm checking for “2”, and since “x” does not equal “2”, this code will not run. One more thing I want to show you is checking for “not equal to 2”. There should be a button above “Tab” (to the left of 1) around that area on your keyboard. If you hold “Shift” and press it, you're going to get this symbol right here (~). One of these next to an equals sign means “not equal”. That means, this code will run if “x” is not equal to “2”. By running the game, we'll see in the Output that “X is equal to one!!” However, “if statements” alone provide limited functionality. Let’s see what “else statements” can do. Compared to “if statements”, “else statements” are actually really really similar. Let me show you all how to use an “else statement”. Let's change this back to “x == 1”. And right here, we're going to change this “end” to “else”. After that, press enter, and it's going to create an “end” automatically. If it doesn't create an “end” automatically, something might be wrong. Make sure you fix it. What I've done here is set “x = 2” and wrote this print statement that says “X was not equal to one!!!” If I were to run the game right now, you can already tell that it's going to print this statement right here. You can already tell it's going to print this one right here. Just for proof of concept, I ran the game, and as you can see, it says “X was not equal to one!!!” “Else Statements” are really simple, and they're really easy to combine with the last section of the video, where we talked about “if statements”. However, another addition we can make to “if statements” are “elseif statements”. Let’s learn about them. “elseif statements” do the same thing as “if statements”, but you can use them to “extend” an “if statement”. As you can see, we can type “elseif” and then we need to input another condition. Similar to how we have “x == 1”, I can make this something like “x == 2”. After that, write: then (so it looks like “elseif x == 2 then”) If you read this as if it was in English, you would be able to understand it because Lua is really similar to English. Let's go through the code. If “x” equals “1”, then it will print “X is equal to one!!” However, if “x” is not equal to “1”, it's going to go down and continue on to the “elseif statement”. Then it’s going to check if “x” equals “2”, and then it's going to print “X was not equal to one!!!” only if “x” is equal to “2”. However, if none of these are true, it will default to running the code in the “else statement”. Once again, we can take a look at this. When “x” equals “1”, it'll print this. When “x” equals “2”, it'll print this. However, if none of these conditions are met right here, then it's going to go down and print this. Let's set “x” to “3” and run the game. As you can see, it prints “X is not 1 or 2!!!” Now let’s try it again, but set “x” to equal “2”. As you can see, it prints “X is 2!!!” Something similar happens when “x” equals “1”. It's going to print “X is equal to one!” Just like that, it printed “X is equal to one!” (on line #4 of the Script) Also, if you end up with these circles on a Script anywhere and you click on them to try to make them go away, know that these are “Breakpoints” and they will cause the Script to stop running. To delete them, right click on them, then select “Delete Breakpoint”. By now, you should have a basic understanding of Scripting. Let's go ahead and learn what “Services” are. The next thing we're going to be learning about are “Services”. You may have seen things like: game:GetService() This is how we actually retrieve Services. In here, you can type the name of a Service. For example, “Players”. Before that, you should create a Variable so I'm going to call this: local players = game:GetService(”Players”) This will give me the “Players” Service. Not all Services are visible in the Explorer, but the “Players” Service is right here. All Services have different kinds of uses. For example, “DataStoreService” is most commonly used to save player data. Let's take a look at the most common use of the “Players” Service. If you're a bit confused by what's happening on this line of code, don’t be worried, because we’re going to be looking at “Events” and connecting Functions later. However, it's really simple. When a player joins the game, we're going to be connecting this Function and inside here you would normally just type the name of a Function, but instead what we're doing is just putting a Function inside, and it looks something like this. This closing bracket at the “end)” is for the opening bracket at “(function” and these two brackets are where you’d put Parameters. Once again, we're going to be looking at this later. So let me show you guys how we use “PlayerAdded”. What I've done here is use “Instance.new” We already learned about what it does, and I've created a folder. What I've done here, is added a Parameter for the player that's joining the game because this will go off every time a player joins the game. It's going to run this code every time a player joins the game and it tells you which player joined the game right here. Now that we know which player joined the game, we can use that in the Function. So what I've done is created a Folder using “Instance.new”, I’ve named the folder “leaderstats”, and I've set the “Parent” property to “player”. As I said in the beginning of this video, Scripting is just changing different properties at different times. What we're doing right here is creating a new Instance, updating the “Name” property, then updating the “Parent” property. Same thing over here. We're creating a new “IntValue”. If you don't know what that is, click the plus and add an “IntValue”. The “IntValue” allows you to set it to any “Integer” / whole number. You can’t set a decimal number (because it’s not an Integer). Now, I’ve changed the name property to “Coins”, set the “Value” property to “5000”, and set the “Parent” property to “leaderstatsFolder”. When I run the game, you'll see that I have “5000 coins” on the leaderboard. So let's take a look at exactly why it did this. When I joined the game, the code went off in this Function, and what it did is it first created a folder. It created the Folder but it did not give it to my player yet. Remember, this folder is not parented to anything at this time. Then I changed its Name to “leaderstats”, and then I moved the folder into the player object that joined the game. We know which player joined the game by using the Parameter right here. Remember, this code runs every time a new player joins the game. The next thing we did after that is create a “coinsStat”. This is an “IntValue” and it wasn't parented to “leaderstats” yet. After that, we set the “Name” property to “Coins”, then we set the “Value” property to “5000”, then we set the “Parent” property to “leaderstatsFolder”. That's why the “Coins” IntValue is in here and that's why “Coins” shows up in the built-in leaderboard / playerlist. There are many different types of Services in Roblox Studio. You can find them all in the Object Browser, as we discussed earlier. For example, “AssetService” lets you get bundle details, AssetIds for certain packages, and there's also other Services. There are about 139 different Services, so it's important that you use the Object Browser to find info about the Services whenever you need them. Another cool Service is “VRService”. This Service has its own Properties, Events, and Functions. It all comes down to how well you can use the Object Browser and the Internet to learn about Services. If you want to dive into all the different kinds of Services on Roblox, check the video description for a playlist that has many of the Services you're going to be using while Scripting. Next, let's actually get to the fun part of Scripting. Let's learn “Events” and how they actually make your game work. Now let’s actually make your game work. Let's use events to make things happen when other things happen. Let's make a variable for the “RedPart”. local RedPart = game.Workspace.RedPart If you take a look in the Object Browser, you'll see that Parts have a certain Event. Remember how I told you guys not to worry about the lightning bolt symbols? These are all “Events”. Let's take a look at them. This event right here is called “Touched”, and this Event goes off whenever a Part touches another Part. We know that a Player’s Character is made out of Parts, so we can detect when a Player’s Character touches a Part. This is how “kill bricks” / “lava parts” actually work. So what I'm going to be writing is: RedPart.Touched After that, we need to connect it to a Function. Remember, a function is a block of code that we can run whenever we call it. I'm going to connect a Function to this Event so the code in the Function runs when the Event goes off. You all should be able to understand this code by now. It's a simple Function. We're calling this Function by connecting it to the “Touched” Event. What happens when the Part is touched by another Part? This Function (”PartTouched”) will run. If you click on this, you'll be able to see that there is a Parameter. This Parameter is called the “otherPart”. So not the “RedPart”, but the Part that touches the “RedPart”. We can actually take that in as a Parameter. It's called “otherPart”. Usually it's just called “hit”, though. Remember, the “Name” property is actually a “String”, so we can print “hit.Name” It's going to tell us the Name of the part that touches the RedPart. If this does not make sense, remember that the “Touched” word in “RedPart.Touched” is an event and we're connecting a Function to that Event. So the code in the Function will run when this Event goes off. This Function right here (the one named “PartTouched”) is the Function we’re connecting. And there's one Parameter that this Event gives us. When the Event goes off, it records the part that touched the RedPart and then it passes it through as a Parameter and we're able to pick that up here. If you're unsure about what Parameters you can get from an Event, just click on the Function and you'll be able to see the Parameters right here. For example, the only Parameter for the “.Touched” Event is the “otherPart”, and we usually call the other part “hit”, so I just named it “hit” here. Let's run the game and hopefully that'll clear up some confusion. The first thing we see is “Touched” and “Baseplate” because the RedPart touched the Baseplate. I'm going to walk on the RedPart, but before that, let me show you all the Character model. I have all these different parts and these all have their different Names and you'll see these Names right here. As you can see when I touch it, you can see all of these Names of different body parts from the Character touching the part. One thing that all these body parts have in common is their Parent, which is my Character. This is important to know for the next thing I'm going to show you all. Before I show you why that's important, let's actually move this Function in here. This is really simple. Just copy the Function, then paste it inside the “:Connect()” on line #8. One thing to note is that this is an “Anonymous Function” that means there will be no name, and I can’t just call it later. This Function will run whenever this Event goes off, so make sure you delete the name right here. You'll be left with the space right here, you can get rid of that. This does look a lot simpler, and if you haven't understood already, this Parameter right here is getting passed into the Function here. This means the “otherPart”, the part that touched the “RedPart” is called “hit”. Inside the Function, I can access that part at any time. As you can see, the parts that were touching the RedPart are printed here because of this Print Statement right here. We were looking at the part that touched the RedPart and printing the “Name” property. Let’s say I wanted to figure out which player actually touched the RedPart. Remember, the parts that are touching the RedPart are body parts, and one thing they all have in common is the player’s Character that they're parented to. So what I can do is write: local playerCharacter = hit.Parent Remember, we always have a Player in the “Players” Service and we have a Character in the “Workspace”. The player usually holds things like your “Backpack” “PlayerScripts” and “leaderstats”, while the Character contains any equipped Tools and Clothing. That's because we can actually see those things in the Workspace. So now that we have our “playerCharacter”, I'm going to print the player's Name property just for proof of concept: print(playerCharacter.Name) Now there's no check here to check if it's actually a player touching the part. So it's just going to print the Parent (specifically its Name property) of anything that touches the part. For example, you can see “Workspace” right here. That's because the Baseplate is inside the Workspace. If I touch the RedPart right now, it's going to print my Username, because some of the Character’s body parts are touching the RedPart. That means all the body parts go through the function and then we’re checking the “Parent” property of all the body parts. All of the body parts are parented to the Character model, and then we’re printing the Parent’s “Name” property. The “Players” Service has a Function that can tell us if a model is a Player’s Character. The Character model in the Workspace when I'm walking around is actually just a model. It has the same Name as my Username. Let’s create a Variable for the Players Service. local players = game:GetService(”Players”) Now, let’s call the Function. I'm going to make a Variable for the player. If you remember “Returning”, what this Function essentially does is it returns the Player object and it doesn't return the Character in the Workspace. That's the player's Character. It returns the Player from the “Players” Service. This helps us access things like “leaderstats”, “Backpack”, and “PlayerScripts”. But remember, this Function will return “nil” if the model isn’t actually a Player’s Character. For example, we saw the Workspace, and since the Workspace does not correspond to a player in the “Players” Service, it's going to return “nil”. To prove this concept, let's write: print(player.Name) and then try it again. As you can see, when the Baseplate touches the RedPart, it gets the Parent of the Baseplate and then it runs that through “:GetPlayerFromCharacter()” Since the Workspace isn't a Character of any Player, it's just going to return “nil”. Since we told it to print whatever it returns, it's printing “nil”. Now, if I were to step on this RedPart, it's going to print my Username. That's because when I step on it, my body parts become the “hit” parameter and then we get the “hit.Parent”, which is the Character model, and then we run the Parent through this Function, which returns the Player. The Player object that it’s returning is my player inside the “Players” Service. That's mostly all there is to Events. You can look through the Object Browser and find all these different types of Events. Some Events are standard and they're on everything, like “AncestryChanged”, “Changed”, “DescendantAdded”, and other ones are unique. For example, “Activated” fires whenever you click the left mouse button with a Tool. (There’s also an “Activated” for GuiObjects such as TextButtons) When I say “fires”, I mean running the code that the Event is connected to. For example, the Touched Event is connected to this code here. Next, let's look at the difference between “:FindFirstChild()” and “:WaitForChild()” Running this code right now prints the color “Really red”. That's because we go into the Workspace and we find the RedPart, then we print its “BrickColor” Property. However, if the “RedPart” was not there and we run the game, it's going to cause an error in the Script. As you can see, the Script has an error and the Print Statement below it did not run. To further demonstrate this, I printed “Code reached line 4!” and it didn’t print that. That's because after the first line, the code didn't run. It didn't even run line #2. That's of course, because of the error. So what do we do if we don't know if there's going to be a part there? For example, if we're looking for a Tool inside a player's Character to check if they're holding it or not, we would use “:FindFirstChild()” First, let’s change this to: game.Workspace:FindFirstChild(”RedPart”) Now, if we run the game, it's not going to throw an error. One more thing to add, is if you are using “:FindFirstChild()” let me show you all how to use the Variable. This is a simple “if statement” where if the RedPart DOES exist, we're going to print the RedPart’s “BrickColor”. However, if it does NOT exist, then we're going to write: warn(”No red part!”) Since it doesn't exist, this condition will not be met because there is no RedPart, and it's going to move on to this code here (in the “else statement”). After that, it's going to continue moving on. It says “No red part!”, but it didn't throw us an error. It said “Code reached line 4!” By the way, “warn” just makes a Print Statement but it’s orange and bolded (in Studio’s dark theme, at least). “:WaitForChild()” is a little bit different. First of all, we don't use “:WaitForChild()” like that. What we’re going to do right here is write: game.Workspace:WaitForChild(”RedPart”) If you know the Script can absolutely NOT continue without finding the RedPart, then we use “:WaitForChild()”. When using “:WaitForChild()”, the Script will pause on line #1 until it finds the “RedPart”. *Even if it takes over 100 days, the Script will stay here until the RedPart appears in the Workspace. (*Extra note by Emancyphur: By default, the Script will output “Infinite yield possible” after waiting for 5 seconds without finding the object (but it will still continue waiting). If needed, you can specify how long it should wait before giving up, like so :WaitForChild(”RedPart”, 10), with the second argument being how many seconds it waits before giving up and continuing to run the next lines of code, even if the object was never found). What I've done in a separate Script is waited 4 seconds, created a part, named it “RedPart”, and then added it to the Workspace. This means the Script will wait here for 4 seconds until “RedPart” appears in the Workspace. Then it'll continue going down in the Script. Let's run the game and see what happens. As you can see, nothing is happening and after 4 seconds it prints in the Output. The reason it printed a different color is because we didn't set the color of the “RedPart” that we spawned in. For example, if we set the part’s BrickColor to “Lime green” and run the game, after 4 seconds, it's going to print: “Lime green” and “Code reached line 4!” If you don't know what “BrickColor.new()” does, basically, whenever you’re setting a “BrickColor”, instead of writing a number or a color in a String, we write “BrickColor” (and then create a new BrickColor by writing “.new”) in a similar way to “Instance.new()”, and inside the brackets, we write a color. To test what you’ve learned so far, I'm going to give you all a little challenge, but before that, I just want to show you all something about the “Humanoid”. Remember, every player has a “player object” inside the “Players” Service, and then their Character is inside the Workspace. And we can use “Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter()” by passing in this model as an *Argument and it'll return the player object. But that's besides the point. In the Workspace, If you look inside your Character, you'll find a “Humanoid”. This Humanoid holds a lot of properties about your Character. For example, when you jump, the “Jump” property becomes true, and when you sit down, the “Sit” property becomes true. Along with that, it also holds your “JumpHeight” and your “WalkSpeed”. However, the property we want to focus on is “Health”. When Health is set to “0”, it kills the Character. Now that you know this, see if you can modify this code to kill the Character. Go ahead and try it out in Roblox Studio. Pause the video right now and I'll reveal the answer in a couple seconds. Don’t worry if you couldn’t figure it out. I'm going to show you all exactly how to do this in a Script right now. Let's say we wanted to make this “GreenPart” kill Characters when they touch it. First, we create a Variable for the “GreenPart”. We know that in the Object Browser, under “Part”, is an event called “Touched”. That means we can use that event in the Script. Let's write: GreenPart.Touched:Connect(function() end) Clicking inside of here tells us there's an “otherPart”. I remember when using “Touched”, we usually just call it “hit”. However, no matter what you name it, it's going to give us the exact same thing: The part that touched the “GreenPart”. I want to use “:GetPlayerFromCharacter()” So let’s create a Variable for the Players Service. local player = players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent) If you don't understand this line, feel free to go back in the video (timestamp 29:32) to learn this function again. Now let's check if there's a player. Remember, if the “otherPart” is inside of a Model, and the Model is not a Character, then “player” will just be “nil” here. Let’s write: if player then Now, inside this code block, we can assume that the player Variable actually belongs to a player inside the Players Service. What I've done here is use “:FindFirstChild()” to check if there's a Humanoid inside the Character, and then if there's a Humanoid, we're going to set its Health to 0. Obviously, since it is a player’s Character, we can already assume that there's going to be a Humanoid, but just for extra safety, we can use “:FindFirstChild()”. Let's go ahead and try this out in game. Walking over to the “GreenPart”... It does, in fact, kill me, and that's because of the code I just wrote. So remember everyone, don't worry if you weren't able to understand this. It’s a little bit complicated, but now that you know, I'm sure that you would be able to do it if you were to be asked again. The next thing we're going to be learning about in Scripting are “Loops”. Loops are incredibly useful in Scripting. This is because of all the use cases, for example, games like “Murder Mystery” are “loop games”. The game is ran over and over again inside of a game loop. Let me show you all a simple Loop that just prints something in the Output over and over again. I'm sure you can guess what this loop does. Every 1 second, it’s going to print “Hello!” in the Output. Let's go ahead and test it out. As you can see it’s printing “Hello!” every 1 second, in the Output. One thing I want to emphasize is that code will NOT run after an infinite Loop. *The Script will be stuck inside this infinite Loop forever. (*Extra note by Emancyphur: Unless you add a “break”, which immediately stops a Loop from running.) Any code before this will run, however. As you can see, it printed “Start of script!” and it continuously prints “Hello!” However, it doesn't go after the Loop. Once again, that's because the Script stops / yields at the Loop. Another type of Loop is a “while true” Loop. These Loops actually crash games and that's because the code runs an infinite amount of times very quickly. That's because there is no waiting in this Loop. It just runs the code as much as it can in as little time as possible. Normally what you do is write: task.wait(Number in seconds) and you put your “wait statement” inside the “while true do” loop. Another type of Loop is called a “For Loop”. “For Loops” are similar in the way that they run code over and over again. However, “For Loops” count numbers. Let me show you all. If you could guess, most people would probably say that this prints every number from 1 to 10. As you can see, it prints every number from 1 to 10 in the Output. That's because the Script works kind of like this: This Number right here is the starting Number (1). We start at “1”. As you can see in the Output, we started at “1”. This number right here is where it stops (10). As you can see, we stopped at “10”. This Number is the “step” (the other “1”). We count up by “1” each time. If we set the step to “2”, it's going to count up by “2”. As you can see, it counted up every number by “2”. The reason we only see odd numbers here is because we're starting from an odd number. We started at “1”, then we went to “3”, “5”, “7”, and “9”. We obviously can't go to “11” because that’s past our stop point (10), so we just stopped at “9”. One other thing to take note of is that the Script actually continued after the “For Loop”. That's because we've finished executing this code. We made it to “10” and then we moved on with the Script. Another important note to make is that we can put wait statements inside For Loops. For example I can wait 0.2 seconds between each Print Statement, and in the Output, there's a noticeable delay when it’s printing these Numbers. I think this right here is a great place to pause the video and take a screenshot. That's because this will help you remember: “Start”, “Stop”, and “Step”. There's actually another kind of “For Loop”. Let's go ahead and take a look at how it works. In the Workspace, I created a folder and I named it “FolderOfParts”. Inside this, I created a bunch of parts and they all have the same Position, Size, and Color. All the parts are exactly the same and they're inside this folder. Now let's say I wanted to do something to all of these parts at once in a Script. We can't just write: game.Workspace.FolderOfParts.Part because that is only going to affect one of the parts, and that’s probably just going to be the first one. That's why we use a “For Loop”. Now, it's important to remember that there are other use cases, too. For example, if you want to loop through every player object in the game, we would do exactly what I'm about to do, except we would do it for the Players Service instead of the “FolderOfParts”. This may look complicated at first, so just bear with me here. Hopefully this clears it up a little more. What this Loop does, is it goes through each of these parts and it runs all this code, one time for each part. To demonstrate this, let’s change the Name of each part. Let’s write: value.Name = number What this will do, is for each part, it's going to set its “Name” to the number that part is, inside the folder. Let's also use a “wait()” so we can visualize it easier. Now that I ran the game, you can actually see in the Workspace, each of these parts are being renamed to numbers. Hopefully that made sense. If it didn't make sense, feel free to join the Discord and ask any questions you have. Now I want to show you all a statement called “Break”. What it does is it “exits” / stops a Loop. It's usually used inside of an “if statement” because there's no other way to really say: “if something happens, break out of the Loop.” What I've done here, is for each of these values (for each of these parts), what we're going to do is check in the Workspace if there's a part called “EndPart” or any object called “EndPart”, and we’re going to break out of the Loop. So let's go ahead and run the game, then create a part called “EndPart”. To demonstrate it doesn't have to be a part, I’m going to use this “ClickDetector”. Let's open up this folder, then let’s name this “EndPart”. As you can see, the parts are still being named, and as soon as I write “EndPart”, it printed “Outside of loop!” If this still doesn't make sense, let me explain it again. What this line of code says is: We go through game, then Workspace, FolderOfParts (right here), and then we “:GetChildren()”, which includes all of the parts right here. Remember what “Children” are from the beginning of this video. The “number” represents the number of times we've gone through the loop. So if this is our 10th time running this code, the number would be “10”. The “value” represents the actual object we're editing. If you saw, we're editing all the parts, one by one, that's basically what's happening. The value changes each time the number goes up each time we go through this loop, what we're doing is we're checking if there's an object in the Workspace called “EndPart”. And if there is, we're breaking out of the loop using this “break statement”. Remember, when the Script finishes this Loop, it goes on to continue here and it doesn't print “Outside of loop!” until we break, as you saw previously. Now, I do want to show you all something. If we open the Workspace and go to the “FolderOfParts”, you'll see everything being renamed. However, if we were to create a Model (or anything else) and rename it to “EndPart”, it's not going to end this code. As you can see, the parts are still being renamed and that's because I made the change on the client side. If I were to switch over to the server side, and then create something called “EndPart”, as you can see, it printed “Outside of loop!” because it broke out of the loop. However, switching back to the client, let's go over why this happened. If I make any changes on the client side, let’s pretend I’m an exploiter and I get access to the Explorer with cheats, what I could do is actually change anything* in the Explorer. That's why when exploiters go into a game, they're able to delete walls and all that, but you won't see that on your screen. As you can see, I'm playtesting the game on two different accounts. This account on the right side of the screen is called “Player2”, and the other account (on the left side of the screen) is called “Player1”. To demonstrate this, I'm going to go to “Player1”, I’m going to pretend that “Player1” is the exploiter. I'm going to get access to the Explorer, I'm going to open up the Workspace, and I'm going to delete the “BluePart”. As you can see, it's gone on my screen (Player1), however, it’s not gone on Player2’s screen. In the Explorer, the “BluePart” is still there. If you're wondering why this happened, it all kind of goes back to “LocalScripts”. If you remember in the beginning, I told you all to make sure you're inserting normal “Scripts” and not “LocalScripts” or “ModuleScripts”, and that's because “LocalScripts” run for the player. That means the LocalScript is run for each player, individually. Each of those players can have anything that LocalScript and other players in the game will not see those changes. However, if I were to switch over to the server side and delete the “GreenPart”, (I'm on the server now) and when I delete the “GreenPart”, you can see the “GreenPart” is gone for both players. This happens because that is on the server side, that's a “Server Script”, and it runs for the entire Server. That was a really basic explanation and if you don't understand, I highly recommend the video I have linked in the description, it'll teach you everything you need to know. The final thing I want to go over with you all is right here. “Size”, “Position” and “Orientation”. Something to understand about these numbers is that they're not “normal numbers” like “Transparency” or “Reflectance”. As you can see in the Script, if I were to try to change the “Position” property like this, it's not going to work. It thinks we’re assigning three different values to one Variable. Just like “Instance.new()” and “BrickColor.new()”, there’s something called: “Vector3.new()” A “Vector3” is basically the group of 3 numbers that we're looking at here. To create a Vector3, we write: Vector3.new() and then we can put our 3 numbers. As you can see, it says: “number x, number y, and number z”. If you go to the “View” tab and you turn on the “View Selector”, you can see the “X, Y, and Z”. Increasing the “X” value sends parts this direction, increasing the “Z” value sends parts that direction, and increasing the “Y” value sends parts upward. If you’ve played “Minecraft” a lot with coordinates on, you’re probably a lot more knowledgeable about this system, and it'll be a lot easier for you. Similarly to the “Position”, I can also set the “Size” and “Orientation”. Just like that, I set the “Size” and “Position” to a Vector3 value. Let's go ahead and run the game to see what it looks like. There's a “BluePart” right there, and in the Properties window we can see the “Size” and the “Position” we set. Because of how Roblox rounds numbers (*also because of floating point errors), it's not exactly “3”, but don't worry, it's pretty much “3”. Pay attention to the “BluePart”. Let's see if we can notice a difference between “2.999” and “3”. It moved about one or two pixels on my screen, however, that will likely never be noticeable and it probably will never affect your game. Let's say I just want to change the “X” axis and the “Z” axis of the “Size” property, and I want to keep the “Y” axis the same. But what if I don't know what the “Y” axis is going to be at this time in the game? One simple thing you could do is write: *“BluePart.Size.X” (*correction in a few seconds) Let me go ahead and show you all this. As you can see, I wrote: “bluepart.Size.Y” The other two axes (the X and the Z) will change to “10”, while the “Y” axis will remain the same (whatever it is now). Let’s go ahead and run the game to take a look. As you can see, the “Y” axis remained the same, and the “X” and “Z” axes were set to “10”. Now that you’re done with this video (it could even be your second or third time), you might have no motivation. This is actually really common, you shouldn’t worry about that. Click this video on the screen and I will motivate you all to keep going and you'll be able to create great Roblox games for this platform. You now understand the basics of Scripting and you can call yourself an “Intermediate Scripter”. However, it’s going to take a lot of practice to become an “Advanced Scripter”. I recommend doing commissions to build / gain experience. Thank you so much for watching this video! If you forgot to, make sure to subscribe! I’ll see you all in the next video.

LcjRb6tiuMk	ROBLOX Studio Tutorial for Beginners!	CovertCode	421329	13:55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcjRb6tiuMk	roblox scripting tutorial	hey what's up guys it's cover code here and in today's video I'm going to be teaching you the absolute Basics on how to use Roblox studio now let's not waste any time and get right to it now the first thing you actually need to do is download Roblox studio so I have a link in the description below taking you to the page I am currently on and this will pretty much show you a summary of Roblox Studio what you can actually do with the Roblox platform and a few quotes from from some famous developers here who have actually had a lot of success and pretty much this is the wiki link so if you have any questions about Roblox or the API this is where you'd go to and you have two buttons here start creating and start creating right here okay and if you click on this it will take you to the download page for Roblox studio and you just have to open that up you know same as installing any other program you've had before and then all you need to do is open it up so now we're just going to transition to Roblox Studio okay so the first time you actually open Roblox Studio it's going to ask you guys to log in but after you log in assuming you remember your credentials okay this is the page that you're going to see and what these are are basically templates for you to use if you've never made the game before so if you don't know how to make 3D models Like Houses cars and stuff like that these are just things to help you jump start your game making career but for the purposes of this tutorial guys I'm only going to be using the base plate template here so this is just basically plain Baron sort of uh nothingness essentially and there are also a few different uh buttons here but I'll let you guys explore those on your own I'm just going to click on this base plate button here and open up our very first game and this is what you're roughly going to see when you open up your game now the tabs might not be here your studio might be white if you're using the default theme however this is roughly what you should be seeing okay so you should have a um blank base plate here okay and you've got some tabs or none at all okay the first thing I'm going to show you guys is how to actually get the Dark theme because I know most of you are going to be asking that so just go to file Okay click on Studio settings and click on the studio tab right there scroll down until you find this General sub tab click on the theme and click on dark and that is how you get the Dark theme now Basics okay you can actually move around on Roblox Studio using the wasd keys just like any other game so wasd like that is gonna move you around Roblox studio if you press Q you're going to sort of go forward and if you press e you're going to go backwards okay and if you hold the right Mouse button you can actually look around so that's the basic of like basics of navigating Roblox studio now let me actually show you how to make a few tabs so if you're following tutorials and you don't have the same exact tabs that they have open I'm going to show you guys how to make those visible okay so the primary way you do this is by clicking The View button up here and here you have a wide array of tabs that you can actually make visible so all you would do is just click on this for example and it made this tab visible if you want to move this around just click hold on the title area right here and this will move around the the tab if you want to like sort of anchor this somewhere like this you're just going to drag this on any area of your screen actually and release and it will put that there okay but I just prefer this down here because you know just personal preference another way to actually view tabs is by going on the model tab here and clicking on these now the only one that you actually need is the insert objects tab right here okay this will actually allow you to insert things into your game especially if you're building or scripting so now let's actually use this and you know create our first part now if you don't know what the part is I have a tutorial on how you can actually build on Roblox so go check that out however this is just basically a sort of piece that you use to build on Roblox and if you click on this and click on this move tool here so go to the model tab click on the Move tool you have one two three four five different tools that you can use for basic building purposes you have the select tool here which you just select things with and click your left Mouse button hold it down and just move things around you have the move tool which allows you to move things in different directions okay like this you also have the scale tool which allows you to resize Parts models Etc okay like this and you also have the rotate tool which allows you to rotate things in different directions as well okay like this specify the you know by how much you move things and rotate things by modifying these values here again I have a tutorial on building so if you want to actually get you know more familiar with the building aspect of Robux Studio then I would suggest watching that now another useful thing is if you just click on the select tool go to the Home tab and select anything you guys want in your game okay you're going to get these three options highlighted we have the copy cut and duplicate okay these are just different ways you can actually clone things in your game so if I right click these will also show up here so you know pretty basic cut paste uh duplicate and you actually just duplicate a part move that around like that so pretty basic stuff again as I said if you want to actually learn about building I have video on that link will be in the description below however let's move on to the more interesting stuff so if you click any object I ideally a part okay and click on this material tool here you're actually going to be prompted okay so click this Arrow here you're actually going to be prompted with this selection sort of list here so you can actually change the material of an object okay so if I want it to be marble as you guys can see I just made that marble okay and you can play around with this all you want but I'm just showing you the basics of Roblox studio now you also have the option to color things so if you click on this um you'll actually be shown this limited color wheel and you can actually just choose a color of your choice and I'm just going to choose red and that's how you color things on Roblox a more sophisticated method of doing this is actually clicking on a part or a model or whatever you guys want and make sure you can actually see properties okay and this is pretty much a list of things describing that object which you just clicked on um and again you would use this if you were coloring stuff uh you know changing the material right here changing the transparency of that you know this is just a more sophisticated way to you know modify the things in your game now one of the most handy things around is the anchor tool so right now if you just go to the properties you can see that it is not anchored now if I move this up okay and I run the game and what I mean by run is imagine someone joins your game that's what happens when you run the game okay so if I click play like that going to load me into my own game okay and as you guys can see this fell down that is because it's not anchored so if I select this and I move it up it's going to fall right back down um okay so a bit of a technical difficulty there my PC just froze but um if you just move that up it's going to fall right back down if you're anchored it's toggled off so if you stop that okay and get back to the studio view click on the object again and click anchored okay and this time when you join back again it will not um you know it will not fall down again so essentially you just anchoring things in place that's why it's called anchor now uh the other tool is lock so see how it can actually select this tool right here if I lock it by clicking on the part and then clicking on the lock okay like that and just go to try and select that again I won't be able to select this or click on it okay but I will be able to to select something which is not locked now the way you'd actually go about unlocking it is just clicking on this lock tool over here click on the part that you want to unlock and there you go now it's unlocked and you can actually select this and move it round once more now one of the most fun things in Roblox studio is the terrain editor okay so if you just go to the Home tab click on this editor button here you'll actually see this tab okay so let me just put this here just for ease of views and these pretty much like this tool allows you to make terrain so let me show you this to you guys so you have three tabs create region and edit click on the generate button to generate some terrain I'm just going to scroll down and click generate I don't care what type of terrain it makes and as you guys can see it's actually making the terrain for me okay so if you ever want to make a map with terrain this is the way you do it now obviously don't do it so carelessly like I did because um it actually allows you to change the the properties of the terrain so if you don't want Hills then you toggle that off but I just you know I just clicked yes and I just made the terrain now the other things like the edit tab here what that does is it also shows you a multitude of tools okay which you can actually use to modify and sculpt your terrain let me just show you a few of these and then you can just go on studio and mess with this yourselves uh so just click add and this will actually add terrain on your well whatever you want really um subtract subtract the terrain pretty self-explanatory so if you want to make a tunnel that's the way you do it uh grow just you know grows things out of the ground so if I want this to be slightly bigger that's the way you do it erode the absolute opposite of that so just digs essentially smooth you know it's smoothing things out and the rest you can just play around with Okay so let's just close the terrain tool that's just you know the region tool does something similar you just select the region and you move it around similar to the move tools but for terrain okay so that's what that does pretty much now one of the fun things uh the more fun things on Roblox studio is actually the toolbox so just go to view uh toolbox and this is pretty much a selection like of how do I say this it's a selection of things that people made for you to use so if you want a house and you don't know how to make a house just search up house and it'll load up a selection of houses that people made for you to use so you just drag those in like that and Bam you have a house in your game and obviously you can do this for pretty much anything so if you want a horse or something like a horse and you drag the horse into your game just like that and that's how you use the toolbox now I've already covered a part of this but if you want to test out your game so if you're learning how to script and you want to test your script or if you just want to test out your game if you're building you just click this play button here okay now you could either play here which essentially spawns you where your camera is you just play which will spawn you where the default spawn location for you guys is and you can just print I mean just press run so what run does is well this it spawns you win camera view essentially so you don't actually spawn with your character the game actually you know runs but your character is not there you just move around with your camera okay so and the way you'd actually go around uh to stopping this is just click stop okay so that's how you stop your little play test and now the final most important thing is you actually need to publish the game so you might have made changes in your game inside of Roblox Studio that's fine however they will not actually be registered by a registered I mean if someone's playing your game they won't actually see the changes live you have to update the game um using something in Roblox studio and the way you do that is just clicking this file button here and just press publish to Roblox or publish to Roblox as I'm just going to say publish to Roblox and this is going to pretty much ask you to make a new game and if you've already published the game then that's just going to publish the game and not show you this window and this is just a few like properties which you can modify about your game um you know pretty basic information you know what devices you want your game to be available on what genre the game is and you know who the Creator is and you're just gonna write a brief description about your game here if you want and you just click create and your game would be published and that guys is how you use Roblox studio just the very Basics so thank you guys for watching like subscribe leave

MUIkOg6UZEM	5 Mistakes to Avoid when you’re learning to Script on Roblox Studio	MikoLikesHat	23950	11:49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUIkOg6UZEM	roblox scripting tutorial	all right it's been like 3 weeks of learning to script maybe I'm ready to become the greatest coder on Roblox ever I just made the best code ever if it works I should sell it and make money I didn't know that scripting is so easy what what why does it work so bad I spent like 2 hours writing it no probably a Roblox Studio bug well too easy I am going to search other tutorial on YouTube oh hi there I don't know why I am here but it looks like you have a problem again that's right the last time you appeared of nowhere again again what the hell are you did you code this um yes I don't want to offend you but that's the most horrible code I've seen in my entire life are you learning to script or what yes and I think it's working I just need to learn slowly practice and don't give up so what are your methods to learn to script I watched a lot of YouTube you tutorials and I bought some random guys course for $80 I think it was worth it and uh I forgot and you think that you're going to learn just for doing that do you just follow the same toad just to copy paste it and suppose you're going to learn everything from a $80 course yes I think so well I think it's great to be here with you again could you tell me some tips of course I don't want an innocent creature like you to waste all your money and time just to learn a simple programming language actually it's not so simple but you can get it in a few days I think oh sorry I like to talk to myself be grateful that I am here I am going to save your time and money and mental health too just for the price of nothing just a little of your time actually really do I have to do something thing yeah just sit and pay attention it's so easy hey welcome to this video if you're watching this you're probably learning to script or you want to get better at scripting or maybe you're struggling to learn scripting and you feel like you're not learning anything despite watching a lot of videos or reading no worries you're in the right place because I'm going to show you five common mistakes people make when trying to learn don't feel bad if you recognize some of these mistakes in yourself it's important to see why you're not learning to script effectively you might just be wasting your time well enjoy the video this is a really common mistake I always see people skipping the basics because they're impatient to learn more or they just want to start doing things with a lack of knowledge but first what does skipping the basics actually mean imagine this little guy wants to create his first game but wait he doesn't even understand the Lewis impacts so he ignores it he has the brilliant idea of creating an amazing game but there's a problem he probably never heard of Loops variables or functions I think you already get it but he doesn't care again so what are the consequences this can lead to confusion in your project because you don't understand the basics of how to code in Lua so what do I recommend I'm glad you asked yourself read that's what I did I know it can be very boring I know but you could save many hours just by reading a little instead of watching those lowquality Roblox coding tutorials with the most unoptimized code ever you could use the Roblox documentation made by the Roblox Community or if you just want to learn the Lua syntax you could search the official Lua website and learn from there there's a lot of information on the internet so don't waste it this may be kind of controversial I'm not against people making coding tutorials on Roblox studio in fact thanks to Alvine blocks I learned to script so that's why I put on the title over Reliance if you're someone who watches Roblox Studio tutorials that's okay I'm not criticizing anyone anyway this is a common mistake for beginners who are starting to learn and want to keep learning maybe you watch many coding tutorials on Roblox Studio follow them step by step and start to feel like you are understanding but when the tutorials end your mind might go blank yeah I know most programmers have that feeling of what do I do now to tutorials are a great way to learn but you shouldn't depend too much on the person teaching you or make the mistake of just copying and pasting the code without even knowing how it works a simple solution is to experiment with coding start by creating small challenges for yourself remember programming is about logic so you don't need to memorize everything to understand how coding works but hey I'm not saying coding tutorials are bad just don't depend too much on them use them to learn new Concepts or to find solutions to specific errors it's simple you're probably not practicing enough you need to understand that programming or coding is a skill if you already play a musical instrument you know how many months or even years it can take to master it when you're learning you need to get familiar with the basics first start by writing everything functions variables debugging errors anything your brain needs to be trained so it could be stored in your memory in simple terms build your muscle memory but maybe you're thinking but like I said I practice a lot and even bought a coding course why am I not learning no worries I'll explain and help you find a solution you might be dealing with something called false sense of Mastery maybe you think that reading the Roblox documentation or watching video tutorials for one day is enough to learn how to code well that's totally wrong like I said before you need to guide yourself and also programming is logic use your brain and creative ways to solve problems when you're coding you might start feeling like you're going crazy not understanding anything but trust me it's worth it just take your time and learn slow slowly and I mean really slowly I've been coding for 7 years and I still forget some simple Concepts if you're tired of watching tutorials or reading endlessly or maybe you feel like your code is a mess or you can't find an error after hours of searching well I've got the perfect solution for you let me introduce the amazing Roblox Dev Community as you can see there's the dev Forum Community like it says it's a forum for Roblox developers where you can ask anything and if you don't speak English you can use the international communities great right just don't click on development discussion if you don't want to use the dev Forum you can always try Discord servers but in my opinion most Discord servers are well people might ignore you if you're a beginner anyway if you engage with a community you'll likely get help from more experienced developers or if you don't want to ask questions use the search bar to look for answers chances are many of the questions you have have already been answered there are plenty of talented developers helping beginners just be polite and don't ask questions like can someone help me make a script that works like a weapon but it's actually a rocket launcher that throws bricks at people and when they touch the bricks they explode and kill the player plus add kills to the leaderboard so you can earn money to spend in a shop with more weapons in yeah don't do that nobody's going to answer that question trust me this is important you need to know that good code needs to be clean readable and follow good practices why because if you want to hire people for your game especially scriptors and you ask them to do a simple task but they see your messy code they're probably going to be disgusted and won't want to work with you one common bad practice I see is using deprecated functions like weight and then I see developers defending it with something like um actually ignore that it's more optimized nice and less complicated duh man could you do a quick Google search and check what deprecated means yeah that read read a simple solution to avoid messy or unoptimized code is to start reading code written by other people analyze what makes their code clean and easy to read many developers use something called module scripts where they break longer functions into smaller ones this is a great way to make your code more readable also stay updated with robloxs changes one day roblocks could change a tiny detail that might break your entire code that's another reason why you shouldn't rely too much on older YouTube tutorials some might be 1 or 2 years old and trust me Roblox updates their programming language almost weekly having good coding practices is essential if you want to collaborate with others or get feedback on your code remember Roblox is an online game so having well optimized code is crucial for ensuring your players enjoy your game well I hope you've picked up some useful tips from this video the five mistakes I shared are some of the most frustrating ones and avoiding them can make a big difference in learning how to script effectively without wasting your time one of the most important things to remember is to take your time learning to script isn't a race you don't have to watch endless Roblox students tutorials either General programming tutorials are great and getting familiar with programming Concepts will really help you if you enjoyed this video I really appreciate a nice comment making these videos can be tough especially as a student your support means a lot	9317	t	This

7nXTqZi0cXc	Why You Can't Learn Scripting No Matter WHAT You Do!	SmartyRBX	18889	4:43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nXTqZi0cXc	roblox scripting tutorial	you've been watching tutorials you've been following guides you've been copying and pasting code hoping that one day something will just click but it never does you're still stuck still confused and still unable to actually script on your own why because you're going about it all wrong first mistake you're copying down code without actually trying to understand it if you're following tutorials word for word and copying the code without truly understanding it you're not learning you're just memorizing patterns and the second you need to write something from scratch you're lost scripting is not just about copying it's about thinking you need to look at the code and ask yourself what does this actually do why does this function exist what's happening when the script runs if you don't know stop break it down and figure it out before moving forward second you lack adaptability when one method of learning doesn't work for you try another if video guides aren't clicking start tearing apart free models in Roblox Studio look at all the scripts work line by line if you don't understand something Google it read the Roblox documentation ask chat GPT to explain the concepts to you in a way other sources won't but don't just ask it for a copypaste solution ask why the code works if self-learning isn't cutting it consider hiring a tutor if one guide confuses you try watching another one the key is adapting if something doesn't work change your approach and you'd be surprised just how many developers make this mistake and some of them don't just fail to adapt they quit altogether don't be like them third you're not practicing enough scripting is a skill and like any other skill it requires repetition you need to practice these Concepts over and over again until they become second nature to you when you watch my scripting guide the easiest beginner guide to Roblox scripting don't just sit there pause the video as you're following along in Roblox Studio try different things modify the code experiment break it fix it and build something new using the concepts presented because here's the truth if you aren't actively coding you aren't truly learning you're just consuming information without applying it four you're trying to learn too much at once here's something most Roblox developers will never tell you you don't need to learn everything you don't need to learn everything about scripting you don't need to know everything about development you just need to focus on learning what actually aligns with your goals if your goal is to make a game learn the scripting fundamentals that help you do that don't get distracted by Advanced topics you don't even need yet so here's how to stop this right now follow What's called the 8020 rule this means that 80% of your results come from 20% of what you learn identify what that 20% is and focus on only mastering

So to start with the normal scripts, these scripts are called server scripts. Basically, they run on the server. So they have something called global game logic and they handle it and also everyone sees the effects of these scripts. So to summarize it, they pretty much handle all player data and data in general. So now for the local scripts, basically these scripts run on the client, meaning that they manage what the player actually sees. So, if you think about it, they handle things like UI, camera, and player input, and they only affect the local player's experience. So, the player on that client. So, now for the most complicated type of script, the module script. They basically define reusable functions and data, and they mostly keep your code organized. They're pretty complicated, but that's mainly what they do.

And don't forget to check the Roblox documentation, you know. Anyways, don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell. So, I think it's >> Why do these scripting videos always recommend reading the Roblox documentation? It's just a huge mess. I'm not going to read everything that this website has. There's a bunch of stuff I don't understand or that just doesn't make sense to me. Or maybe I just don't know how to read. I don't know. Anyways, this tutorial wasn't great, so I'm going to look for another. >> Relying on tutorials again. Oh god, why is it always the people teaching the wrong way who become famous? You were trying to read the Roblox documentation, right? I'm guessing you either don't know how to read it or you think it's useless. Do you know any documentation whether it's for coding or game engine is a really important part when you're trying to learn any concept? Right. >> I know. I mean I know how a website works. Of course, it's just that I don't want to read everything on that site. And honestly, there's a bunch of useless information, man. I just want a script, you know. >> Oh, well, silly. You don't need to read everything to understand a simple concept. But obviously, you do need to read. What you need to know is which information is actually useful to you and how to search for it. For example, let's say you want to learn about the touched event. Do you know how to find it without getting lost? No. I thought so. >> Well, I guess I rely on tutorials too much. I don't want to stay stuck in this endless learning loop. >> You know what to do. Sit down, focus, and actually pay attention. YouTube. Hey, welcome to this video. As you saw in the title, you want to understand this big document, the Roblox documentation. And honestly, if you ask me, I also didn't see much use in it. Oh god, I was so wrong. So, if you're someone trying to learn how to script or code, this video will definitely help you on your journey. Understanding the Roblox documentation will improve your coding skills, just like it did for me. And seriously, stop relying on bad tutorials. One of the best things about learning from the doc is being upto-date with the information. So if you're someone who still uses weight instead of task weight, well, a little reading won't hurt you. So enjoy this video. Before we start talking about scripting, we need to understand the Roblox documentation. Don't skip this part. Maybe you don't even know what the Roblox documentation is or how it works. Basically, the Roblox documentation is a big guide or book for Roblox Studio in general, not just for scripting. It contains almost everything you need for developing, modeling, monetizing, scripting, building, and a lot more. Anything related to creating a game? Now, you might be asking yourself, why use this if I could just follow Roblox tutorials? Well, the Roblox documentation is very detailed, especially for coding. Instead of relying on outdated tutorials, you get accurate and updated information. That means your game will be more optimized, your code will be better, and of course, if you put the effort, you'll probably impress people enough that they'll hire you for their games. Using this huge resource will make you a better coder. You will spend more time understanding scripts instead of just copying random ones that probably won't work. So yeah, change that mindset of but the Roblox documentation is so boring. I was acting just don't be lazy. Now let's talk about how to actually use it because I haven't explained that yet. I guess you already know how to search a website. Just type Roblox documentation and there it is. Now, when you open it, you'll see a lot of information, but we're not looking for avatars or assets right now. What we need to do is click on the left learn. You'll see a bunch of buttons. Don't get scared. If you're afraid of learning since this is a scripting tutorial, we're going to focus on engine API. If you see this page, congrats. You now know how to access what the Roblox Studio engine has to show to you. But here's the thing. Once you start exploring, especially in classes, you'll see tons of information. Some of it might feel useless. Some of it might be important. Like I said before, we don't want to waste our time reading a bunch of stuff that isn't helpful for you. That's why I always use a strategy to keep things efficient. For example, let's say I want to learn about part.touched. What I do is click on the search icon, type base part.touched, and boom, it takes me straight to the base part page, especially to the touched event. Now you can read for yourself what it does. >> But how do I actually use this as a method to learn scripting? >> Good question. I'll explain that in just a moment. Before we go explaining this, you must already know the basics of scripting like variables, functions, and a basic understanding of coding. If you don't, you may not understand anything in the Roblox stocks. So, I recommend watching my last scripting video or searching for any YouTuber that explains it well. All right, we'll use the touch to vent as an example. The most obvious step is just read. It's too hard to read for you. Once you finish reading the concept about the touch event, you can go into the coding example. Sometimes some documentations don't show the coding example. But that doesn't mean you can't learn. The coding example gives you an idea. But what we want is to learn, not copy the coding and pretend that we learn something. What I did when I was learning to script is this. I analyzed the coding example and I did it my own way. For example, I made this simple script. As you can see, I took everything from the Roblox document and I even used this parameter to know which part was touching. Now, let's try something a little more advanced with services like tween service and you repeat the same process. Read the most important parts of the documentation. But wait, if you see concepts like number, frame, uden, and those things that you may not understand, don't worry. Just click the blue highlight and you can understand by yourself. All right. If you saw the coding example and you still don't understand like the create event, just scroll down until you find create. One of the things I always notice are parameters like I said. And of course, read the description. To make a tween, you need the instance, the tween info, and a dictionary or to make it more understandable, a table. And again, you repeat the same thing with tween info if you don't understand it. With that knowledge and a little idea of code, I can make a tween script by myself. But I always know scripting. So you can see how the part is moving with the tween service. Pretty cool, right? I think at this moment you can get the idea and I hope you actually see the utility of using this document. You don't need to follow the same strategy as me. Read, check code examples and experiment. You may even find a better strategy than mine, but feel free to explore everything that the Roblox document has. Every concept that you want to explore or understand is there. So before we go into the conclusion I want to show you some tricks using the Roblox document while you're using the Roblox docs for example let's say you're searching about run service and you specifically want to learn about heartbeat you can just do this controll + f type heartbeat and there it is you can also try searching Roblox documentation insert what you want to know on Google And most of the time it will show the correct result right at the top and send you directly to the documentation page. Not really important, but I usually see people bookmarking important pages. That way you can return later without needing to search for them again. Well, at this point, you should already know how to use it. Anyways, the Roblox stocks aren't just for scripting. Like I said before, it's actually a huge resource that covers everything about the Roblox Studio Engine in general. If you want to know how to export 3D models, there's a page for that. If you want to know how to monetize your Roblox game, there's also a page for that. You can use the Roblox stocks as a learning resource. Like I've said in many videos, instead of thinking you learned something from a random YouTube tutorial, you can try to learn directly from the source. Some people learn better by reading, others by watching videos. It depends on you. Try both and experiment to see what works best. For me, I said for me personally, reading is better. So, now you already know another Roblox resource for scripting, building, or really anything. Well, I don't have much more to say. Thanks for watching this video, and see you next time.	8878	t	The content addresses 'tutorial hell' and the common struggle of navigating technical API references, providing a high-value bridge for beginners moving from copying code to professional documentation usage.	{"Roblox documentation","Roblox scripting tutorial","how to learn Luau","Roblox API reference guide","Roblox task.wait vs wait","Roblox developer learning path"}	2026-01-08 15:18:56.412798	\N	\N	[{"apis": ["task.wait"], "problem": "Replacing legacy wait() functions with the modern task library for better performance", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": true}, {"apis": ["BasePart.Touched"], "problem": "Detecting when a player or object physically interacts with a part", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["Engine API"], "problem": "Navigating the Engine API to distinguish between useful class properties and irrelevant information", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "intermediate", "automatable": false}, {"apis": ["Global"], "problem": "Identifying and implementing basic coding constructs such as variables and functions", "category": "Scripting", "difficulty": "beginner", "automatable": false}]	Leveraging Roblox Documentation and Engine API for effective scripting and code optimization	f	\N	\N
LeAvAbDYpPk	Roblox Scripting Tutorial for Beginners: The Fundamentals	The Unknown Dev	5509	37:11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeAvAbDYpPk	roblox lua tutorial beginner	if you want to learn how to script this video is made just for you my goal is to get you all to understand why something works rather than just knowing that it works the five fundamental parts of programming are variables conditionals functions loops and tables by mastering these you can pretty much do anything that you can think of but I'm going to give tables its own video now before we jump in this is how I'm going to format this series this is where most videos stop the last two parts are the most important part of the entire video I can't canot stress enough how important the challenges are also if you've already learned some of the concepts in this video feel free to skip to any of the time stamps I have set now let's hop in the studio so there are three panels you should always keep open we got the output properties and the Explorer so let's go and open up a script so to create a variable all you got to do is type local and you can name this variable whatever you want all it has to do is start with a letter of the alphabet three different data types we have are numbers and then we have strings which can hold a string of characters and then we have booleans that are holding a value of true or false so now to use these variables we've named it something string booleans and if we want to go ahead and use these we can go ahead and print them out print out numbers or wait no we got something string and booleans so now if we go ahead and run this you can see that it's printed 2013 the string and false which is exactly what we have these variables so right now these variables pretty much have no meaning you might wondering what are they even used for so let's give them some meaning so let's say we have level and let's say our level is three and we can go ahead and print level and it's three right here and then let's say right here we leveled up so we can do level equals level + 1 and now if we print level it's going to print four right here and so if I go and run this as you can see it prints three and then it prints four so we have edited um what was assigned to level and there's actually a simpler way we can do this we can um just do plus equals and then we can do one and that's the shorthand version of just writing level equals level + one now you can do this for any sort of um operations we have minus equal 1 and we have divide equals 1 and these are just the shorthand version of doing level equals level divid by one or minus or Plus or times so this isn't the only way we can modify variables we can have multiple variables or level uh we can call this one gain we can do six and we can modify level by using our new variable gain and so we can do plus equals gain and this right here is the shorthand version of doing level equals level plus gain and so now right here this is going to act as level equals 3 plus six and so it's going to be nine um if I get rid of this line and so if we try this out we should get nine in the output right there and so now level was incremented by gain so that's pretty much how numbers work let's go ahead and talk about strings so strings can be named anything you want I'm going to name mine super this is my username and you can go ahead and print these and print the output like we talked about but what if you wanted to edit this string there's many ways you can edit the string but the one way I'm going to go over for this video is we can do dot dot and we can add other strings to it so I can add is awesome and it's going to say super right here dot dot and it adds this is awesome and this right here is called concatenation whenever you add two strings together that is concatenation so if we run this as you can see it's going to print super is awesome it can cut any of the strings together and it printed it out so this right here doesn't actually edit the variable it's just um editing it inside this print and then it's going to print it out if we want to actually edit the variable you can do do do equals and we can add is awesome to it and so now if you print just Name by itself it's going to print the entire string this just look a little bit gross but it um that's just a short handwriting of name equals name dot dot is awesome and we can print this out and it's going to run twice super is awesome so let's go ahead and move on to conditionals I'm going to to find some basic variables to say I have coins of 500 and my level is 1 and now to do a conditional you can do an if statement and we can do coins and we can do greater than equals 100 then so if my coins are greater than or equal to 100 it's going to run inside this little block right here and so what I wanted to do is I wanted to add to my I want to add one and then I want it to take away from my coins 100 so now if I have more than 100 coins it's going to add one to my level and take away 100 coins and so at the very end of my program if I print level and I print the coins if I run this code you'll see that I'm level two and I have 400 coins now the next part to if statements is that we can also do else now this part right here runs whenever this statement is false so let's say I have five coins now this portion is not going to run I can say print to broke so now that I don't have over 100 coins if I run this program it should print to broke because I don't have enough coins let's go ahead and try and change this up a little bit let's say we have this Boolean called Ford now we can just take this right here and we can move that to a Ford and now we can just put if aord there because this is now Boolean we're setting it to the value of coins greater than or equal to 100 so if we print a forward it should either print true or false because this is a Boolean expression um and then it's going to check it down here and if it's true it's going to add level and if it's false then it's going to do two broke so as you can see it's false because we don't actually have enough coins also one way we can make our prints a little cleaner is you can actually do um some text here level and then you can C you can concatenate the level onto it and so now it's going to print level here we can do the same thing for coins if we wanted to we could do coins and then we could have the coins variable here and so now it's going to do level colon and then add level and the same for coins and let's go ahead and give us some coins so that we can run something so if we run this bullion's true because we can afford it our level updates to two and our coins change down to 150 so you can kind of start to see how these Basics are used all the time in games and how you really need to get these down to be able to do pretty much anything so let's go ahead and make this a little more complicated let's um let's add another variable call it Stone and let's give us around 100 there's more things we can do with booleans um there's things like and and or uh I'll just do those two for now so let's say we need both we both need to afford it and we need Stone to be greater than 50 so it needs to be 50 or greater if we want to buy it so now both of these booleans need to be true for us to be able to afford it um so now if we ran it at this point it would still work because we have 100 Stone but if we have or 50 Stone but if we have less than 50 Stone um as you can see it's going to say two broke we can afford it but we're too broke because we don't have enough Stone and so or this one works a little bit differently now if we have or just one side of this expression needs to be true and since a forward is already true um it's not even going to check this right here because it knows it's or and since this side's true it doesn't matter what this side is it's just going to run this program right here and it's going to work so if we have or as you can see we can afford it and it's going to change your level up and subtract coins now one more thing we can do with booleans is there's another keyword called not and so basically what that is going to do if parentheses around it it's going to take this Boolean whatever it results to not is going to flip it around so if this is true this is going to change it to false if this is false this is going to change it to true so if we run this program to see what happens it changed to false because we originally had 250 coins which is enough and it was true and it flipped it to false with not so that basically just inverts whatever Boolean it's tied to we can also chain these um if and else statements we can continue it on and we can add an if here so now it's an else if and there's this red line because we don't have a bullan expression here um so let's say this means that we can't afford it and we also don't have enough Stone so let's say we can't afford it let's go to 50 let's get rid of this knot so we can't afford it we also don't have enough Stone and let's say but we have at least 25 coins we don't have we don't have zero we have at least 25 25 to 99 is going to be in this range because we don't have any stone we're less than 100 coins but we have greater than equal 25 coins so right here we're going to print um some coins and then we can move this to the last else statement so now we can't afford it but we do have some coins um but we aren't like insanely broke so if we run this program afford is false but we do have some coins and level doesn't change coins don't change now I'm going to move on to functions at this point so let's go ahead and get rid of this and I'm going to define a function local function I'm going to give it a name uh let's call it buy and so press enter and here's our function everything inside this block and these right here here are the parameters so I'm going to make this the type of upgrade that you want to buy um so you just that's a parameter you can pass in to call this function you just type bu and then as you can see there's my variable parameter and I can pass anything on one side here I can pass in 10 and if I were to print type here this would be 10 and you can call this again um and so now it's going to print 10 and then it would print string so if I just test it out so you all can see we have 10 and string so now let's say I want to use this type to figure out which type of upgrade I want to buy so this will buy upgrade one this will buy upgrade two so I can do an if statement if type and to check numbers you're going to do equals equals that's how you can check numbers so if type equals one then we're going to do this um but if type is two then we're going to do this down here so uh this will be buy upgrade one and then this one down here will be buy upgrade two so if I to run this as you can see that one's going to buy upgrade one and this one's going to buy upgrade two um we could take us a little further we can do uh if we bought upgrade one it's going to increase our level by three and if we buy upgrade two this is going to increase the level by 10 so just to see that this works we can print level on both of these um and so our level starts out at one we call buy one we call buy two and our level is going to upgrade to four then it's going to upgrade to 14 because after this first upgrade it added three then after this second upgrade it added 10 to that so it went to 14 also functions don't need parameters you can just put them in if you want to so I just put a parameter in here also type is not a very good parameter name because it is also a keyword so just keep in mind of that uh I can change this to T to make it a little better um you can just name whatever you want but yeah it just doesn't need parameters you can do no parameters if you want you can still call it this will just be null because I'm not passing anything in and you can also do as many parameters as you want so these are all just variables like we've talked about um but they're defined by whatever you pass in right here so now T will be 1 a is 2 B is 3 and and C is 4 so that's how the parameters work also I don't know what's talking about this this just means that this side equals this side that's basically all that means so T equals equal 1 means that t is 1 that's what that means now the reason there's a tab after functions and if statements is because each of these things have a scope to it you can slightly see this gray line that goes down here and this right here is the scope of this if statement this right here is the scope of this one and this is the entire scope of this function so if I were outside of the scope like over here and I tried to print a as you can see there's going to be a red line and it would air because this a only exists inside of the scope also one other thing the variables everything is only defined after the fact that you define it because it runs top down so if I tried to print level above level as you can see there's a red line because level currently does not exist the thing I'm going to go over for functions is um the return statement so if I had let's say a function that gets a color and I pass in a choice now I can check this Choice let's say the choice is one it's going to run inside here and if the choice is two then it's going to run here we have a return statement and what this is going to do is it's going to send back Valu to whatever called the function so let's say I have two different options here I have blue and green and now down here I can actually use this value let's say the color equals we're going to call the function get color and we're going to choose option one so now if I print color um and run this notice it prints blue so it actually returned this value back to where it was called from so how this runs is it runs we on line 10 go to line 11 color equals get color one so it goes up here passes in one it runs here oh we find out Choice equals 1 it returns blue we go back to here now color equals blue and then I printed it out one thing about return is that as soon as return is um used inside a function whever it's used it's going to immediately exit the function so if I had farther code down here and say I print something at the end of the function it's never actually going to reach this print because it returns either here or here so if I ran this code as you can see it prints blue but it doesn't print um something uh the only way this would actually print is say I got a color that was three it's not going to reach any of these options so it never returns and it just prints something and color should print uh nil so I printed something and I printed nil because no color was actually returned so nil value was set to color now the last thing I want to go over before I put everything together is loops and Loops have a start and they have an end and I'm going to go ahead and Define these as variables you don't need to Define them as variables and to start loop we're going to create a new variable and I'm going to name mine increment and we're going to Define it to be start to the end which is STO for me and then you end it with two and so now if we go ahead and print this out I'm going to print out increment this is the new variable we defined it's going to start here and it's going to stop here by default it's going to increment by one um a better way of doing this is iteration actually this will be an iteration and this is going to demonstrate what's happening in this Loop every iteration is going to print this right here whatever this equals so if I go ahead and run this you'll see it'll print 1 2 3 4 5 because it started at one and stopped at five these variables represent what each part of a loop is um um but the most traditional way is you have 4 I equals and then you choose some numbers here and this will do the exact same thing as before so if I go ahead and run this you'll see it 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 now this next part of a loop is what really opens up the bounds of what we're allowed to do so this is the start this is the end but there's a third number that you can put in and this is an increment so I could change this to three and this is what it's going to increment by so if I change this to do something like s and if we do print I and if I go ah and run this you'll notice it prints 1 47 and that's because it's now incrementing by three so you might be wondering at this point what happens if our start number is higher then our end or what if we have our end at 8 and it since it increments by three it's never going to reach eight it'll go from 7 to 10 and how it works is it's going to start at 1 and and then it's going to do the loop well it's first it's going to check is one less than 8 and if it is it does the loop and once it gets back it does it over and over and over and as soon as it realizes it's greater than the stop it's going to immediately stop after this increment um and it's going to check immediately from our starting number so if I had 98 it's not going to do anything as you can see nothing prints in the output and like I said if it starts at 1 it should stop at 7 because after it adds to 10 it realizes it's going to be p eight so it's not actually going to do anything with that but if this were at seven it would still do the exact same thing I would have to change it all the way to 10 if I want to see a difference also if you didn't already realize it's going to run from top down so if I printed something up here then first this prints then the loop runs and if I had something beneath it say this where the end um it's going to print start it's going to print all of the loop and then after it's done with Loop then it's going to and then you and print end at the very end and it's going to run all the code that is down here so it's going to run top down so if for R this just for example start and then ends right after this can get complicated really fast I have to add some more things into it before I go into that there's one more thing um about these Loops is I is a variable like normal but if I tried to add five to it you would think it's going to first start at one add five so it's at six then it prints six then it adds three then it'll be nine and then it does it again and it's going to past 10 so it's only going to print twice you would think but if I go ahead and run this you'll notice that print 6 9 12 and 15 and this is because these Loops um they're predefined and whenever you edit I it's not actually going to do anything um so it's going to take one add five to it it's going to take three add five to it and or four and add five to it and so on and it's not actually going to change the structure of how the loop already runs this is different from other programming languages where when you edit I it will actually change the way the loop runs it won't just be immediately defined up here you can usually edit it inside the loop but in Roblox you just can't do that now Loops is where we can use two um new keywords so let's make an if statement let's say I equal 4 um and we can do something like continue and this is a new cool keyword that we can use so I'm going to print I down here how this going to work is it's going to start at one it's less than 10 so it's going to run and it's going to check is I4 it's not going to be four so it prints one and then it goes back now it's going to be four and when it gets uh to this continue keyword what continue does is it skips the rest of the loop and it starts back at the next increment so as soon as I equals 4 it skips everything and it immediately increments it to seven and then it continues again so if I ran that for an example as you can see it skipped four because I put continue on it and it just skipped the rest of the loop the last keyword I'm going to show you is called break so if I replace this with breake it's similar to continue but it's going to instead of go back to the next iteration it's going to immediately break out of the loop so if I ran this it's going to only print one and it just exits the loop because once it equals four it breaks and it stops if I change this to 7 and I ran this as you can see it prints 1 4 and at seven it exits the loop and just continues code down here now I'm going to try one more complicated thing I'm going to do a loop inside of a loop and I'm going to make these the same increment and for now I'm just going to make it print um the values so it's going to print I then it's going to print all of J then it's going to print I and just so it doesn't get confusing I'm going to add um this string right here so you can tell what is what so if I put this here change the I now let's go a and run this and as you can see in this output uh if I go to the very top I is 1 then it prints J all the way 1 to 10 then I is 2 1 to 10 I is 3 all the way down till I is 10 and it prints J 1 to 10 so you can easily calculate um how many times this runs so I runs 10 times J runs 10 times inside of I so in total it runs runs 100 times now that we have a rough understanding of the fundamentals I'm going to uh create something rather fun for us so let's say this represents X and this represents z um I'm going to get rid of these prints I'm going to generate a grid using these coordinates so let's say I pass in an X and the Z value and we haven't gone over this I'll explain it in a second but let's say we have a part and it's going to equal instance. new and I'm going to create a part and now with this part I'm going to just set it size to um we'll do one one and then I'm going to set its position um to a new vector and it's going to be x and z I'm going to put it uh this guy I forgot there's three okay and I'm going to set the parent to be game. workspace so now this creates a part and it's going to set the size to a 1x one by one tiny little block and it's going to change the position to be this x coordinate I pass in the Z coordinate I pass in and five studs however high that is then it's going to set the pair in workspace so we can actually see it and now all I'm going to do is I'm going to create a part in every single iteration so at the end this is going to create 100 parts if I pass in x and z uh one more thing so the parts don't fly everywhere is I'm going to Anchor them uh so I'm going to set anchor to true so they don't just fall out of the sky so if I go and run this um as you can see I have this uh grid right here and I can select each of these parts these are all separate parts and I generated this grid by using this Loop and a function now to explain how this works we've gone over Loops we've gone over functions this is called for every iteration of Z and this entire Loop is uh run for every iteration of X so this is Run 100 times with each unique coordinate of x and z now in this iteration this right here is instance. new instance. new just basically lets you create anything you want so if you go in the workspace and press this little plus sign you can create any of these things inside instance. new so if I wanted to create a tool or a folder inside a script I could just type folder and here is my folder right here um since I don't want to just create it and not be able to use it I assign it to a variable so now this variable equals this new part I created now that I have access to it I can edit it however I want um so if I have a part and you click on this part we have these this properties page um and it has all these properties we can change and how we can change those is all we have to do is go part and Dot the property you want to change and then you can just change it and set it to New value um so size uses a vector 3 so I have to pass in a new Vector 3 which is X Y and Z and then position is another Vector 3 but this one I want to use x and z because this one I want to change based on whatever I pass in and then anchored just means I can change it anchored so it's either false or true it either has physics or it doesn't um and then I Chang the par to workspace cuz if I didn't do that this would just be a random part in code and it wouldn't have a parent so it wouldn't exactly it wouldn't exist anywhere in the Explorer because I didn't assign it to a parent um so this part right here the parent is the workspace if I moved it here the parent would be the base plate now I'm going to try and make something a little bit cooler to open your eyes to the possibilities um so let's go ahead and make 100 um X so it's going to go I have 100 parts in The X extraction and let's make this a little bit fancier we can use math and there's a bunch of math functions we can use but one I'm going to pick is I'm going to use sign I'm going to put X inside there and I'm going to offset it off the ground by 10 so it's 10 studs in the sky plus whatever the sign value is so as it um goes across the X it's going to produce this uh sign offset based on whatever the sign value is it could be like negative 1 to positive 1 and so with that we should get this really cool wave of effect so if I run this code as you can see there's this nice little sine wave of Parts as the X changes and if I wanted to make it smoother I could divide this by five so now it's going to have a less like it's going to change across the wave slower because X is now a fifth of whatever the value was so now if run this code as you can see we got this nice smooth wave and as you can see we can create a lot of really cool things with this this um just to see what happens we could say try also adding let's do Z and see what happens when we do that if you run this code we get this really cool effect where it's tilted on the z-axis and if I want to see a little bit more of what's going on here I can make it go faster and let's also make it go five times farther in the Z Direction and now we have this really cool grid wave effect going on here where it's ALS it's changing both in the X Direction and the Z Direction and this really cool wave effect now I'm going to take it one step further and I'm going to change the color um so there's a few different ways you can change colors we have new. from RGB HSV but the one that's going to suit me best for this is HSV so HSV represents H saturation value and H is the value that goes across so this is like a rainbow effect saturation is how much of the color we have so it goes to White and to the full version of that color so this is high saturation this is low saturation and then we have values this is how bright it is so we go all black all the way back to the color so I'm going to try and create something cool also you realize it ranges from 0 to 1 so this is zero this is one and same with saturation and value so I like 7 for saturation so I'm going to use 7 for saturation and value and I'm going to try and make a cool Rainbow effect since it only ranges from 0 to 1 um I'm going to take x and z and I'm going to divide it by let's say 200 so it's never it's never going to reach something cu the highest value we have is 150 so it's never going to reach one which means it's not going to break the bounds and we're just going to add x and z together divide it by 200 so now as x and z increases it's going to go across the rainbow so if I try this out you'll see that starts around zero which is red and we have this nice rainbow effect going across our wave of parts now this last thing we to go over is while Loops so with while Loops it's going to take a Boolean expression and while this Boolean expression is true it's going to run the code inside the while loop and as soon as it turns false it's going to exit the while loop so if I put while true here it's never going to exit the while loop because there's no possibility of X in the while loop but it works the same as continue and break so if I ever put continue inside this while loop it's going to skip the code and go to the next iteration and if I ever put break it's going to exit the Y Loop no matter what and it's going to continue the code after the loop um so if we have a loop that runs forever it is going to be a little bit dangerous you could crash your program so one way we can do this is we can put weight up here and this will weight the smallest amount possible uh if you want to go a little bit smaller you can do test. weight doesn't really matter too much though uh this will act as a true statement and it'll run forever but it'll also weight the smallest amount possible so it doesn't try to run a billion iterations as fast as possible so now with this while loop I'm going to do some experiments um using this for now I'm just going to use this uh spawn plate um just so I don't to create a part and I'm just going to do some fun things with it so Insider while loop first I'm going to gain access to this spawn location so I can change it and do things to it so I'm going to create a variable for it and this variable is going to equal this spawn location so do game. workspace and spawn location is a child of workspace so to access it all I do is Dot and spawn location and the parent of spawn location would be the workspace so I could do parent do spawn location and that would be the same thing though that is redundant now that we have this spawn location I'm going to go ahead and try something out let's go ahead and change the position let's say we want to increment the position by a vector 3 and let's move it along the X Direction by 01 studs and we're going to change nothing else so position equals position plus this new Vector 3 is going to move move along the extraction by 01 studs as fast as it can um waiting this much per change so if I run this as you can see our spawn location is slowly moving in the X Direction I'm going to try one other thing let's say I Define t = 1 I'm going to try and rotate the spawn so T is going to represent a rotation and I'm going to make it increment by one every iteration and and so this is going to be 1° and I want it to rotate all up to 360° and go back to zero and rotate 360° again so one way you can do that is we have this percent operation so I could do tal T percent 360 so what this does is takes three divides it by 360 and then it's the it equals the remainder so if I had 5 / 360 the remainder is 5 because it can't divide and five as the remainder if I have 360% 360 um then it's going to take 360 360 there's no remainder because it equals 1 and so it would equal zero so then T once it equals 360 it resets to zero which is exactly what I want if you had something like 365 uh% uh 360 this would result to five because I have a remainder of five um and the name for this percent sign is modulus or modulo so that's what people call that and so this is going to increment T all up to 360 resets to zero all up to 360 and it just continues that forever now I'm going to do the rotation aspect using our new T that constantly increments from 1 to 360 so C frame is similar to Sy position but this represents rotation also so I want to change rotation position doesn't have rotation attached to it and I want to change rotation so I'm going to set it to a new C frame but I want to change it to the spawn position so now this C frame is a C frame that represents the spawn the position of it but it strips it of any rotation that it has because as you remember position is a vector 3 it has no rotation so this new C for create has no rotation now I want to rotate it with my new T value so to do that we're going to multiply our C frame by an angle and I'm going to rotate it in the X Direction and this takes radians so I want to convert my degree to radians CU I'm using degrees 1 to 360 um and I'm going to convert that to a radian and then I'm going to rotate it nothing in the other directions this is just going to rotate in the X Direction by as 3° so now if I go and try this out you'll notice that it's rotating along the X Direction and it's spinning in a circle um and I'm going to go ahead and try another direction if I try the y direction spin in two directions and so as you can see now it's spinning a little chaotic it's spinning both the Y Direction and The X Direction at the same time you can do a lot of cool things with this now this video is already around 35 minutes long and I don't want it to go on forever from first video so I have set up four different levels of challenges for youall to do after this tutorial um so here's the first one it's this staircase we have four parts and it just goes up one stud as it goes up so you try and generate this using the script the second one is a cube that slowly changes colors Over the Rainbow and repeats it forever and then this one does the same thing but it's moving in a circle forever and and then this one is just a generated circle using a bunch of parts and it generates a full circle so those are the four challenges I have set up for you guys and the goal for these challenges is for you to be able to write each program on your own um by yourself without using any help uh and this is just inspiration I've set some different difficulties if you want to try to progress as much as you can um you should be able to do each of these with just the tutorial I have given you and I will give the solutions to each of these challenges uh for the code I wrote in my next video so youall can see how I did it if you didn't figure it out or if you just want to see how you differed from mine also if anything was confusing you could join the Discord that's linked to my channel and ask any questions there I'd be happy to answer the last time I asked you all to subscribe I went from eight subscribers to 800 subscribers so if you all do that again

72jPOsUr_Bc	Final Game - Roblox Beginners Scripting Tutorial #18 (2025)	BrawlDev	328620	23:59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72jPOsUr_Bc	roblox scripting tutorial	welcome back to my Roblox beginner scripting tutorial series my name is balev and this is the final episode of our beginnner scripting tutorial guide and if you've made it this far into the series then huge respects to you because I think a lot of people would have left by like the second or third episode so the fact that you've made it this far means that you're really interested in being able to make a Roblox game and you're fully committed to making that happen which I'm really proud of so basically what we're going to be doing for this episode is we're going to be taking everything we've learned up until this point and we're going to create our first game as I'm going to show you right over here this is essentially going to be taking everything we've learned and we're going to create our first game by doing so so I'm just going to show you what this game is if we hit play when we go to test and basically what we have here is an obstacle course now this obstacle course is a little unique compared to a traditional obstacle course or Obby or whatever you want to call it so first things first is we have these yellow balls over here where if we touch it then it's going to increment our leader stat that we have up here called coins and it's going to be a random number from like I think 1 to five where if we step on it then it's going to change our coins value to something between one and five and it's going to add that to our leader stat and it's also going to make it transparent as well just like this but the main thing about this obstacle course is we have a button for each stage for this obstacle course so if we step on it then the gate at the end of it is going to open and there's going to be a timer at the output showing how many seconds we have left before we make it across so once we do make it across then it's going to close the gate and if you didn't make it in time then you would have to go down and press the button again so this is stage two which is basically the exact same thing except we have a smaller time frame so as you saw right there I barely had enough time to actually get through that thing and so we basically just continue from here on out every single stage we make is basically the same idea where we press a button and then there's a certain amount of time that is going to pass before the gate closes on the other side and so and taking everything we've learned we're going to recreate this obstacle course but I highly highly encourage you to try making this game yourself first with everything you've learned before we start implementing it inside of this episode so with that being said if you've attempted to make this game by yourself then we can go ahead and go straight into implementing so I've loaded up a fresh base plate here and it's completely up to you whether you want to create a new place by going to file and then hitting new for this episode or you could just use the same game that you've been using throughout this entire tutorial guide completely up to you and one more thing I would like to mention is if there's at any point throughout the video where I'm speaking too fast or if there's some parts of the video that just confuses you then I encourage you to rewatch those bits and you can even play the video in 0.75 times speed to make the video slower so that you can take in the information better but once again that's up to you and now that I've addressed that let's go ahead and create our first game on Roblox so what we're going to do is go to the Explorer hit the plus sign next to workspace and we're going to insert a model now with this model we're going to rename this model to our main game just like this and then we're going to add folders to this main game and there's four of them that we're going to need so let's hit the plus sign insert a folder just like this and we're going to rename this folder to coins so we're going to need one for coins and what I'm going to do is right click and duplicate this because we're also going to need one for the gates and we're going to duplicate this again we're going to need one for our buttons and then finally we're going to need one more for the stages themselves so now that we have our folders the next thing we're going to do is create all the parts that we need to make up one stage and those three being the gate the button and the obstacle course itself so let's go and go into the home and we're going to insert a part so this part is going to resemble the button that we're going to be using for the first obstacle so what I'm going to do is rename this part to let's say stage one and I'm going to go down and I'm going to hit anchored so that it's not affected by gravity whenever we step on it and then we're also going to change the brick color of this to like really red and we can change the material of this to Neon as well and I'm also going to scale this down by clicking on the scale tool and we're going to just scale this down like so so now we have our stage one button that we have over here and we can place this inside of our buttons folder just like so okay so that's the first part but next thing we need is our gate so we're going to add another part like this and we're going to call this one stage one as well we're going to make this gate let's say some sort of green color like this and we're also going to go down and check anchored once again and we can just basically scale this up just like this so that it resembles a gate and now we can drag this into our gates folder just like so so now we have the button and to the gate for stage one but now let's create the actual obstacle for stage one so what I'm going to do when once again is insert a part just like this we can scale this however we want just like so it doesn't really matter too much and now that we have this we're going to go down and we're going to hit anchored once again and what I'm going to do for each stage is I'm actually going to insert a model so inside of the stages folder we're going to hit the plus sign and we're going to insert a model and I'm going to call this stage one again and I'm going to drag this part inside of stage one and now that we have this I'm going to duplicate this part and I'm going to move it along this way just like so just so that we have some platforms over here I'm going to duplicate the same thing just by going like this I can even take these three parts and just duplicate it like so and so we now have more to work with like this and now that we have this we have our first obstacle pretty much so what we're going to do is basically take this part and we're going to duplicate it like this and I'm also going to scale it just like so so that we have a PL platform over here and I'm just going to recolor this bit to some sort of blue and now that we have this we could basically take our gate so if we select the gate on the explore and we select the move tool then we can basically just move it up here like this if we're able to just move it over here and we cover it up so that we can't bypass it like this then that should basically be everything that we need and we're also going to take our button and we're just going to move it over here so that it's at a reasonable spot and now we basically have our setup for the first stage so now that we have this we're going to create a script and make the game functional so what I'm going to do is actually go on server script service and I'm going to hit the plus sign and we're going to insert one in server script surface we're not going to do it inside of workspace but we're going to do it inside of here instead so I'm just going to delete the script that's over inside of here and we're going to create a couple variables so the first thing is accessing the main game so we're going to say local main game equal game. workpace and we're going to use wait for child as well so we're going to hit colon wait for Child open close parentheses and then inside of here we're going to say main game just like this and then we're going to create more references specifically for the gates and the buttons so what I'm going to do is say local Gates equals main game colon wait for Child open to close parenthesis and then in here we're going to put Gates and then we're going to have one for the buttons as well so we're going to say local buttons equals main game colon weight for Child open and close parentheses and we're going to put down buttons just like so okay now we have our gates and we have our buttons but the thing we want to do with the script is we want to make this functional when we step on the button so that it can find the right gate that it's looking for so that it can open up the gate so to speak so what we need to do is basically access all the buttons and then make them quote unquote pressable or touchable by the player um one thing I forgot to do is go to our script and we're actually going to rename this to our main script just like this um just for organization purposes that's what we're going to do so here's basically how we get a table full of all the buttons so that we can go through each of them so we can make them functional what we're going to do is say for index comma button in pairs open close parentheses buttons colon get children open and close parentheses do and and then we're going to hit enter so basically we're going to use get children to get a table of all of the buttons that are inside of this buttons folder and then we're going to use this button variable to make a touched event for each and every single one of them now for this index variable we can actually just put an underscore because we're actually not going to use this key variable right here so what we're going to do now is say button. touch colon connect function open close parentheses enter and we're also going to pass in the other part that we're trying to detect and what we need is to check whether a humanoid touched it or not so we're going to say local humanoid equals other part. parent colon find First Child open close parenthesis then we're going to look for a humanoid then we're going to hit enter and now what we're going to do is say if humanoid then and then we're going to hit enter just like this now there's something we need to add to the button that I forgot to mention and those are some instance variables that we're going to be using and changing inside of a script so inside of our stage one button we're going to hit the plus sign and we're going to insert two values the first one is going to be a Boolean which is going to check whether this current button has been touched so we're just going to rename this to touch just like this and we're going to insert another value that's an INT value just like this and we're going to rename this to duration which is going to be how long this gate is going to be open for so we can say that this gate can be open for about 10 seconds we're just going to change it to that and we can leave the touch variable unchanged and so what we're going to do is basically locate our touched variable that we have here so we're going to say local touched equals button colon find First Child open close parentheses touched just like this so now what we're going to do is say if humanoid and touched and touched. value is equal to false now the reason we're saying touched here is because we're trying to see if touched actually exists as a value and then we're going to check if the value of touched so this thing down here if it's set equal to false so it hasn't been touched yet so if we're able to confirm all these things then we can make the button pressable so what we're going to do is we can actually create a new function and just put that inside of here so what I'm going to do is declare a new function up here by saying local function activate button just like this and then we're going to put an open close parenthesis and we're going to hit enter so now we can pass in our activate button function down here and there's actually a few things that we're going to pass in so the first thing is going to be the button and then the second thing is going to be the touched variable as well so we're going to put in touch just like this so then we're going to do the same thing up here by passing in Button as a parameter and then we're going to pass in the touched um instance value as well so now what we're going to do inside of this function is say touched. Val is equal to true and then we're going to locate the duration value as well so what we're going to do is say local duration equals button colon find First Child open and close parenthesis duration just like this and then we are now going to put a task. weight for however long the duration value is so we're going to say duration. Val just like this and then we are going to say touch. value is set back equal to false just like so so we now have a button that activates but now what we need to do is actually make the gate associated with this stage to be I guess open so here's how we're going to do it what we're going to do is basically locate the gate that we're looking for and then we're going to open it up and the way we're going to do that is we're going to say local gate equals gate colon find First Child open close parenthesis and what we're going to oh sorry Gates that's what I meant to say and then inside of here what we're going to do is say button. name and the reason we're doing button. name is because when we're looking for the stage one button this is the name of the button and if we go inside of the gates folder we're trying to look for the same exact name so that we know that this is the state gate that we're trying to look for that's why we passed in button. name instead of looking for the specific name that we're looking for so then once we find the gate we're going to say if gate then we're going to set the transparency of the gate so gate. transparency is set equal to 0.5 and then we're also going to make the gate can Collide uh set equal to false so basically what can Collide is if we select gate there's a property here called can Collide and when this is set equal to true that means whenever our player is touching the part then we can't pass through it but if we set it equal to false then that means the player can actually pass through the part so that's what we're going to be doing here by saying gate. can Collide is set equal to false just like this and so this is how we basically open up the gate for the player to be able to walk through it now after a certain period of time we're going to have to basically take these variables and make the gate back to what it used to be so we're going to select these two lines we're going to copy it and then we're going to paste it down here so I'm going to make the transparency zero and I'm going to set the can collide of this property back to true so that we now have a functioning script over here now if we want to be able to print this out inside of the output what we can do instead of a task. we is write a for Loop now what we can do here is basically say local timer equals duration. Val just like this and what we can do is write a while loop by saying while timer is greater than zero we can say do timer equals timer minus one and then up here we can say task. wa for about 1 second and then we can even write a print statement at the very start here by basically telling us what the timer value currently is so we print the timer wait 1 second and then we decrement the timer variable by one until it reaches one or something that's not zero so this is basically our entire main script right here so if we go into the game and hit test and hit play then we should basically see our first stage be functional so if I press the button then it's going to show down here that we have 10 seconds so that we can reach this stage and we are now reaching the other side of this gate and then once the timer has finished then it's basically going to close up again so you have to go back and press the same button again so if we go back and press the button one more time then it should be working just as expected so now what I'm going to do is hit stop and the next thing we're going to add is coins so basically we're just going to go inside of model we're going to instead of creating a part we're going to hit the drop down here and we're going to create a sphere so what we're going to do with the sphere is we're going to rename this to coin we're going to set the brick color to some sort of yellow and we're going to make the material to Neon and we're also going to set anchored equal to true and we're also going to set can Collide equal to false just like this so that the player can walk through it and so now that we have this we can basically just move this inside of our platform I'm just going to put it somewhere here I'm I'm going to put it right here so now that we have this what we need to do is create a new script for our leader stats so in of server script service we're going to hit the plus sign we're going to insert a new script and we're going to rename this one to player stats just like this and now what we're going to do is create a player added event so we're going to say game. players. player added colon connect function open and close parentheses we're going to pass in the player argument and then we're going to hit enter just like this so we're going to create a new leader stat for this player so we're going to say local leader stats equals instance. new open close parenthesis folder and then we're going to set the name of this folder so we're going to say leader stats. name equals in all lower case we're going to say leader stats like so and then we are going to set the parent of this leader stats folder to the player itself and now we're going to add a coins leader stat to this leader stats folder so we're going to say local coins equals instance. new and then inside of here we're we're going to add an INT value and then for the coins name we're going to say coins. name is equal Al to coins just like this and then we're going to say coins. value is set equal to zero and then finally we're going to put the parent of this coin's value to the leader stats just like this so now we've created our leader stats script right here what we need to do now is basically take all the coins that are inside of this coins folder so what I'm actually going to do is take this coin and move it inside the coins folder so what I'm going to do is basically locate the coins that we're going to need for this script so what I'm going to do is say local main game equals game. workpace colon wait for Child open close parenthesis main game and then we're going to locate the coins folder by saying local coins equals main game colon wait for child and then we're going to say coins just like this now we're going to use another pairs Loop for every single coin that we touch so we're going to say 4core comma coin in pairs in parentheses we're going to say coins Co get children because we're trying to get a table of all the coins rather than the folder itself so then we're going to say do just like this and then we're going to add a touched event to the coin so we're going to say coin. touched colon connect function open close parenthesis enter just like this and then we're also going to insert the other part as well now one other thing we're going to add to this coins variable is by adding another Boolean value inside of our coin and then we're going to rename this to touch just like so so what we're going to do first is locate the the humanoid once again so we're going to say local humanoid equals other part. parent colon find First Child open close parenthesis and then we're going to add a humanoid just like this next thing we're going to do is we have to locate the player of this humanoid because we need to be able to change the coins value of the player based on the humanoid that we provided and there's actually a function inside of players that allows us to do this so I want you to copy exactly what I do so what we're going to do is say local player equal game. players colon and this function is going to be called get player from character just like this and then inside of these parentheses what we're going to do is say other part. parent because we are passing in the character and we're trying to see if there's a player object that exists within the character if that makes sense so then what we're going to do is locate the touched variable by saying local touched equals coin colon find first child open close parenthesis touch just like so and now we're going to do our if statement so we're going to say if humanoid and player and touched and touched. Val is equal to false then so we need to make all four of these checks and if every single check here is valid then what we're going to do first is say touch. value is set equal to true and then what we're going to do is say player. leer stats. coins . value is equal to the same thing here so if we just copy this and paste it on the right side plus one so basically what we're doing here is we take the player we get the leader stats folder of the player then we get the coins stat then we update the value of it to whatever it currently is and then we set it equal to one now if we want to make this more readable what we can do is basically just delete this and then say plus equals 1 so it takes whatever the value of this is and it adds one to it just by using the simple compound Operator just like so so once we add the value to this what we can do is we can visually change the coin Itself by saying coin. transparency let's say we set this equal to 0.75 and now we basically have a finished game if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see is if we step on the button then it's still going to be visible and if we hit on this coin then it says that it adds one to our coins but there's one final touch that we need to add to this and that is adding a random coins amount when we step on the button so what we can actually do down here is say local random amount equals math. random open and close parentheses and then we're going to have a range of 1 to 5 just like this and so once we do this we're actually going to replace the one with the random amount just like this so now if we go into the game and hit play then it should give us a random amount when we step on this uh coin so we step on it and it gave us four coins instead of one and if we step on this one again then it's going to give us another random amount from 1 to 5 so we've now finished our very first game like if you were able to catch up with me throughout this entire episode then good on you for that but one more thing that we can do is add another stage and how we're going to do that is we're basically going to create a another model by saying model over here we're going to make stage two just like so and then we can basically just take our part that was over here we can duplicate it and then move it alongside this way we can drag this inside of stage two and then we can add like a little obstacle course here by just duplicating and then moving it to the right side here duplicating move to the right side here we can even take all three of these parts duplicate it and then move it alongside here again until we reach the other side so what I'm going to do is duplicate this part that we have down here just move it along side this way and we're also going to take this gate we're going to duplicate it we're going to rename this to stage two and then we're going to move it this way uh so once we do that then we can also take the button down here so we're going to duplicate it and then move it up here so we're going to move it up here just like this so that we have a button to press for the next gate and I'm also going to rename this to stage two just like so and that is how you add more stages to this obstacle course that we just created so if we go into the game and we press the button then we should be able to go into the next stage and if we press this button then it's going to open up the next gate that we're trying to look for and so this is our final product we can also dup duplicate this coin by moving it this way we can even duplicate It Again by moving it up here and we can finally do it one more time just by moving it down here and now we have a final game if you were able to recreate this game while following along with this tutorial guide then you should be proud of yourself like you you were able to create your first game on Roblox with everything that you were able to learn from this entire tutorial guide and this is definitely going to help you for when you go to the advanced scripting tutorial guide and even the gu tutorial guide as well and this is a long journey like I said becoming a Roblox game developer is not easy and if you able to make your first game just by following this tutorial guide then you're definitely ready for whatever else that there is going to be for you with the future episodes that you're going to be watching with the advanced scripting tutorial guide and also the gy tutorial guide so that is basically the entire beginner scripting tutorial guide if you found this to be extremely helpful then leaving a like on this video and also making a comment on like everything that you were able to do inside of this tutorial guide would definitely be very helpful and I would love to see what you have to say about this tutorial guide if there's anyone who you know would like to make Roblox games then I encourage you to recommend them this tutorial guide as well for them to watch and now that we've made it this far I would like to say congratulations this has been an extremely fun journey and I would love to see what else that you'll be able to make Beyond this point but with that being said that's basically going to conclude this tutorial guide I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video take care	26143	t	This content bridges the gap between learning isolated

udv7SG5ZTbQ	Operators - Roblox Beginners Scripting Tutorial #10 (2025)	BrawlDev	281402	13:14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udv7SG5ZTbQ	roblox scripting tutorial	welcome back to my Roblox beginner scripting tutorial series my name is balev and in this episode we'll be discussing about operators so just like at the start of every single tutorial we've been doing up until this point we're going to uh click on our script that we created in the previous episode we're going to disable it and then we're going to insert a script inside of the workspace by searching up script like this inserting it and then we're going to right click and rename this to the name of the episode which is going to be operators like this and then we're going to hit enter and then we're also going to delete our code here so now I can introduce to you what operators are so in the last episode we were introduced to if statements which basically allowed us to check for a specific condition that needed to be met before we executed specific parts of our script so an example of this is if we were to write if let's say true then we're going to hit enter and then we're going to write a print statement here saying this statement is true just like this and if we were to run this inside of Studio obviously it's going to print so if we go to the game and hit play then it's going to say this statement is true because what we did was for this condition we literally gave a Boolean condition of true so this automatically makes it a true statement so that's the basics of using uh if statements but now for the purpose of this episode I'm going to be introducing to you a bunch of operators that can add more complexity to our conditionals so that we can have very precise and effective uh comparisons that doesn't just restrict to one condition here we can have multiple conditions and we can even compare different things depending on what the operator we're using is so basically there's two types of operators that I'm going to be introducing to you and the first one is going to be logical operators so logical operators is what allows us to add more conditionals to the same if statement that we have over here so instead of just having one conditional we can have more than one conditional to see if more than one condition is met before we go inside of this if statement and print out whatever's inside of here so the first logical operator that I'm going to be showing you is the operator called and and basically what we're going to do is on the right side of true we're going to hit space and then we're going to write an all lowercase and uh and then we can now put in a second conditional on the right side of this an statement so we're going to say U let's say false is all lerc case so this statement Compares true and it also Compares false and in order for this statement to be valid for um for this conditional to be met both the left conditional and the right conditional needs to be true and in this case because the left side is true but the right side is not true that means this statement actually isn't going to uh run because this conditional uh was invalid so if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see is nothing inside of the output because we told this if statement that both the left and the right side needs to be true in order for this statement to be valid uh based on this and logical uh operator so if we hit stop then I'm going to go back to our script and I'm going to be showing you another logical operator called or so all we're going to do is replace this and keyword with or just like this and basically what or does is it checks if one of these conditions is true so because this statement is true it's automatically going to go down to this print statement without even checking whether this right side is true or not because for or all we need is just one of these statements to be true so that we can move on to uh whatever the code is inside um this if statement so that is how we use and and that is how we use or now if I were to make these inside of a different example with using numbers then I'm just going to delete this and let's say if 2 + 2 is equal to 4 and if let's say on the right side uh we can say if 5 + 5 is equal to 10 so this left side returns true because 2 + 2 is equal to 4 and this right side is going to return true because 5 + 5 is equal to 10 so if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see in the output is this statement is true and if we hit stop and go back to our script and if let's say we were to change this statement on the right side side to be if 5 + 6 is equal to 10 so in this case this is not going to be true anymore if we go into the game and hit play then it's not going to print anything inside of the output now if we were to stop and go back to our script and change this keyword to or instead of and then only one of these statements need to be true so if you go back into the game and hit play then what we should see in the output is this statement is true because 2 + 2 is equal to 4 and that's all we need to know about now there's one more logical operator that I want you to know about and that is called not and we actually don't put that in between two different statements but instead we're going to put this before one conditional statement so what this is going to look like is we're going to delete this code that's over here and what I'm going to do is say if not like this and then we're going to put a conditional after this one so we're going to say if not true then print whatever is down here now basically what not does is it gives us the opposite of whatever this conditional statement is over here so this true statement is actually going to return false because the not keyword gives us the opposite of true which is going to be false so if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see in the output is nothing being printed because this actually printed false instead of true now if we hit stop and then go to our script and then change this to false then it's going to return the opposite of false which is going to be true so if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see is this statement is true and now if we were to hit stop and make this into a numerical uh example so I'm just going to delete this and what we're going to do is say if not 2 + 2 is equal to 4 then uh we're going to print the statement now obviously um this statement is true but because we have the KN before it it's actually going to return false now the thing that you have to be careful about with this is we actually have to put in parentheses uh inside of our Boolean expression so let me show you what happens if we actually don't do this so I'm going to go into the script and hit play it's going to show in the output that it that it attempted to perform in arithmetic on Boolean and number and the reason it did this was so if we hit stop and go to our script it did this because it's reading this by saying if not two you can't compare not with a number so what we need to do is insert parentheses like this so that we know that we're trying to compare this statement specifically so 2 + 2 is equal to 4 that's going to return true but the not is tied in front of it so it's actually going to return false so if we go into the game hit play then what we should see is this statement oppat turnic false so that is basically uh logical operators inside of Roblox studio and that is something important that we need to know about for our conditionals now the next set set of operators I'm going to teach you is what's called relational operators and this has to do with the way we've been comparing um conditional numbers and this has to do with the way we've been comparing um equations inside of our um conditionals so I'm just going to delete everything we've had in this code up until this point and what I'm going to do is say if 2 + 2 is equal to 4 just like this so relational operators fall into what we've been doing with this comparison it's of here so if 2 + 2 is equal to 4 which it is then it's going to return true this is one relational operator which is the equals relational operator but there's actually multiple different ways we can compare this relational operator that isn't just restricted to the equals and there's actually six relational types that I'm going to be showing you one by one so the first one is the equal sign and the next one I'm going to show you is the opposite of that which is going to be not equals and so basically what we're going to do is place this first equal sign so we're going to hit backspace on this and we're going to replace this with a squiggly line that looks like this so I'm going to hold shift and then I'm going to hit the squiggly line now for me it's located on the um top left of my keyboard so I hope you're able to see it but when you do make this squiggly line before the equal sign this represents not equals so if 2 + 2 is not equal to 4 then it's going to print this statement over here now now this used to be true but now this is actually going to return false because it's trying to say if 4 is not equal to 4 which is not true so if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see in the output is nothing because we're trying to say if four is not equal to four which is not true I hope this part is making sense to you so far so now there's two more operators that I want to show you so I'm actually going to delete these two lines right here and what I'm going to do is say if 2 + 2 is greater than four so greater than is um indicated by this right arrow over here and basically what this means is if this number on the left side is greater than this number on the right side then it's going to um return a true statement now obviously this is not going to return true so if we add uh let's say 2 + 3 is equal to 4 so 2+ 3 is equal to 5 then it's going to be greater than four so this is going to be a true statement so if we go into the game hit play then what we should see is this statement is indeed true so I'm going to hit stop and then we're going to go back to our operator and we can basically do the opposite by saying if 2 + 3 is less than so if we put in a uh left arrow symbol before whatever is going to be on the right side then this is going to compare if this is less than what's on the right side which obviously in this case five is not less than four so this is not going to be true so if we go into the game and hit play then we should not see anything be printed in the output so I'm going to hit stop once again go back to our script and now there's two more relational operators I want to show you so we learned about greater than and we also learned about less than but now we're going to say if this is greater than or equal to so basically what this means is if this statement on the left side is greater than this statement on the right side or if it's or if it's equal to whatever's on the right side then it's going to um make the statement true so if I say 2 + 2 is is greater than or equal to 4 2 + 2 is not greater than but it is equal to four so this statement is going to be true and we can do the same thing for uh the less than symbol as well by replacing this greater than symbol with the less than symbol just like this and this is going to compare if the less if the left side is less than or equal to whatever's on the right side now I do want you to be careful because a lot of people get this mixed up where they have the equal sign on the left side before the operator on the right side so you can't say equals greater than this like it's some rocket symbol right here uh or less than like this you have to make sure that the operator is on the left side of the equal sign um when you are comparing greater than or equal to or less than or equal to so that is the basics of using relational operators and logical operators inside of your scripts and um if there was some parts of the script that and if there were some parts of this video that confused you then I encourage you to rewatch certain parts of this video so that you can nail the down inside of your head so that you can understand how adding operators inside of your conditionals work inside of your scripts so with that being said for today's learning objective what I want you to do is continue experimenting with adding more conditional statements by adding more operators inside of your conditional statements by I don't know adding another and statement with uh 5 + 10 is equal to I don't know 15 and you can just continue onward with what you want to add for your conditionals now another quick thing I want to mention is that you can have more than one um logical operator inside of here as well so we can have an and here and we can have an or here with another conditional and then we can have another and here with another conditional and it can just keep on going for as long as you'd like so that's something else you can do with your conditionals and I recommend experimenting with adding logical and relational operators inside of your scripts and once you're done with that then I want you to go down to the comments and paste whatever code you feel comfortable sharing to everybody else so that everyone knows what you've been up to with these challenges as well as yourself so with that being said that's going to be it for this episode I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next episode take care	13392	t	This tutorial addresses the fundamental developer hurdle of managing multiple conditions in code by explaining logical operators in Luau,

4cxqWRmtqyY	FindFirstChild & WaitForChild - Roblox Beginners Scripting Tutorial #14 (2025)	BrawlDev	265443	15:37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cxqWRmtqyY	roblox scripting tutorial	welcome back to my Roblox beginner scripting tutorial series my name is balev and in this episode we'll be discussing about find first child and wait for child which are two functions that Roblox has provided to us that's going to be very useful in locating objects within our game and it's also useful to help us understand the structure of how a game is structured so to recap a game is basically comprised of all of these different folders that have its own specific use cases like let's say this workspace it shows all of the parts that we can see within this 3D world that basically make up the workspace of the game now when we're understanding this hierarchy like if we open up this workspace this workspace has all of these different objects that are within this workspace folder the workspace in this case is called a parent and everything that's inside of this workspace is a child that belongs to the workspace parent and we can continue going down this list by finding more objects that have stuff contained within them like this base plate so this base plate has a texture child and this base plate is the parent of this texture child and this base plate is the child of this workspace parent and so you can kind of understand the structure from here on out with how the parent and child structure works inside of the Explorer so with that understanding now let me show you some things that can help us organize these parts before we start using these functions so there's two ways we can organize stuff within our game uh one of them is being models and the second one is being folders and I'm going to show you what both of them do so if we go inside of the Explorer and we click on the plus sign next to workspace and we insert a model like this so I'm going to click on model uh it's going to add a model inside of the workspace now basically what a model does is it groups Parts together to make up one big part as a whole that's basically a model so if we go into the model Tab and we click on parts so we part here I'm going to go to the right side and I'm going to rename this part to part one and what I'm going to do is drag this into the model that we just created and now I'm going to duplicate this part so I'm going to hit control D and I'm going to select the move tool like so and I'm going to move it this way and I'm going to rename this part to part two and I'm going to duplicate it one more time and I'm going to move it this way and call this one part three now since all of these are contained within a model if we hover over one of these parts then it's going to select all three of the parts because it's all contained inside of one model so if I select one of these parts then it's going to select the model rather than the individual part itself and we can drag this model around and it's going to drag all three parts along with it because it's all contained inside of one model now let me show you what a folder does so if we click on the plus sign and insert a folder like this and let's say we take all three of these parts I'm going to select the first part I'm going to hit control while selecting the other two parts like this and I'm going to drag it inside of the folder So within this folder we can still select the folder and drag it around like so but if we go into the game and we select one of these parts then it's going to individually select one of these parts or at least when we hover over it to then move it around if we want to do so just like this so that's like a slight difference between a folder and a model but generally what I would say is you should use a model if you want to group Parts together to make up one big part but a folder can be more generalized and can be used to organize Parts scripts and other sorts of assets you can use inside of your game so that's like a short introduction to models and folders but why is this important well this is going to be important to understand the parent and child relationship when we're using these two functions inside of our game so what I'm going to do is Select these parts again and I'm going to move it back into our model and I'm going to delete this folder so the first function I'm going to show you is find first child and what we're actually going to do is insert a script not inside of the workspace but let's insert a script inside of the model that we just created so I'm going to hit the plus sign next to model and I'm going to insert a script okay and I'm going to delete this code that's inside of here and now what we're going to do is first locate our model but what's interesting about this is because we have our script inside of the model we actually don't need to locate the model from the game data model and then into the workspace and then into the model itself so what we would have done is we would have said uh local and then the name of the model which we can just call model like this we're going to set this equal to game. workpace do model we don't need to do it like this but instead we can do it from the script itself so if we were to actually delete this we start at where the script is located so in all lower case we're just going to say script which basically tells us that we are currently located inside of the script right now and we want to get the parent of this script which is going to be the model so we can just say script. parent and this is going to locate the model rather than doing game. workpace dood just like this both of these basically do the exact same thing because we put the script inside of the model as a child so now that we've come to that understanding let's locate let's say the first part here so what we're going to do is drop a line and then we're going to say local part 1 equals model do part one so this is how we've been able to locate parts or other objects within the game it's basically by using a DOT and then whatever the name of the object is but now this is where the first function comes in which is find first child and let me show you what this looks like so instead of saying dot part one we're actually going to delete this and we're going to replace this with colon find First Child open and close parentheses and inside of these parentheses we're going to put the name of the part that we're trying to to look for so in quotations we're going to say part one now why are we doing it like this instead of doing Dot part one like we've been doing in the past well let's say in this case we have a script that's trying to look for a part that's contained within this model let's say this part is not here so if we were to just delete this part and it's just gone from the model then the script is going to try to look for a part called part one that's in the model but part one is not here so the script is is going to throw in an error saying that there is no such thing called part one if we were to just locate part one inside of the model but what this function does with find first child is it's going to check the model for a part one and if there's no part one then it's just going to tell us that and we can handle the error if that ever comes to be the case so what I'm going to do is hit control Z as in zero so we can bring the part back and I'm going to go back to the script and what we're going to do down here is check if part one actually does exist so we're going to say if part one then we're going to let's say do something with this part like change to the brick color of it so we're just going to say part 1. brick color equals brick color. new open and close parenthesis and inside of these quotations we can pick a random color here I'm just going to say um Coco and then I'm going to hit enter like that so if we go into the game and hit test and hit play then what we should see inside of the game is part one has changed its color because the script was able to find part one within the model now once again this is just a safety precaution to let us know that if the script decides to not find the first part then it's just going to skip this if statement and it's just going to continue with the script as is without throwing an error inside of the output I hope that part has made sense to you so if we hit stop and we basically delete the first part and if we go into the game now then it's not going to throw in an error but it's also not going to change the part of part one because obviously there's no part one inside of the model so it's a safety precaution to be able to look for something if it doesn't exist because there's a chance that it won't exist and that is the purpose of fine first child and I hope that this has made sense to you so now what I'm going to do is hit stop and I'm going to hit control Z again to bring the part back and now let me introduce to you the second function that's going to be useful and that's called wait for child now basically what this does is it lets Roblox wait to look for a specific object within a game for a specific period of time and if it doesn't look for it then it's just going to skip it and it's going to continue the rest of the code if it did not look for it and we can handle the script accordingly to whether Roblox was able to find it or not so what this is going to look like is let's say we drop two lines and we were to look for part two so we're going to say local part two equals model colon weight for child just like this open and close parenthesis and we're going to specify part two inside of here now basically what's going to happen is Roblox is going to run the script and it's going to look for If part two exists within this model which in this case it actually does exist Once We join into the game so once we do that then we're just going to let's say make a print statement saying part two has been detected just like this so if we go into the game and hit play then what we should see in the output is immediately says part two has been detected because it's contained within the model that we created but let's hit stop and let me show you what happens if we delete the part and then bring it in after a certain period of time so what I'm going to do is take this part and I'm going to right click and hit cut so that it's contained within our clipboard and what I'm actually going to do is go to test and click this dropdown and hit on run so that all we're going to see is our camera so once we see this then it's going to say in the output after a certain period of time that it says that there's a warning that says infinite yield possible on waiting for part two because Roblox took a while to try and see if part two existed but in this case it actually didn't so if we go into the workspace and we go into the model so I'm going to rightclick the model and I'm going to hit paste into just like this and now it's going to say that part two has been detected because we used the wait for child function to see whether the part was actually going to be detected and since it was added to this model that's when we decided to continue executing the script because of it and it's very useful for situations like this if we're trying to wait for something to be added into a model or into the game itself so that is basically how we use wait for child and also how we use fine for child inside of our game if something in this video didn't make sense to you then I encourage you to rewatch some of the bits before we move on to the final part of this video which is going to be a practical example of using fine for child so now what I'm going to do is hit stop and I'm also going to hit control Z to bring part two back so for this last part of the video we're going to be making what's called a kill brick and basically what this does is if let's say our player was in the game and we decided to step on this part the part would kill us and it would basically reset our character um kind of like if we were to play an obstacle course and if we touch a part that we shouldn't be touching then it basically kills our character and that's what's called a kill brick and we can use what we learned in the last episode with with the touched event and also combining it with fine first child to make a kill Breck so that's what I'm going to be showing you how to do for the rest of this video so what I'm going to do is go to the model and we're going to insert a part like this and we can change the brick color of this to Red so that we can uh say that this is a kill brick and we're going to go to the right side and we're going to rename this part to kill brick and then we're going to hit enter so what I'm going to do is insert a script inside of the kill briak so I'm going to hit the plus sign and I'm going to insert a script just like this I'm going to delete this code and we're first going to make reference to the kill brick which once again we can do from the script that's inside of this kill brick so we can say local kill brick equals script so we're located inside of the script and then we're going to say dot parent just like this and now we're going to use a touched event for this kill brick so we're going to say kill brick. touched colon connect function open close parenthesis and then we're going to specify the other part that's inside of here and then we're going to hit enter just like this so what we need to do in order to detect if this is a player that's touching this kill briak is we need to find what's called a humanoid so I'm just going to demonstrate to you what this humanoid is really quickly by going to test and we're going to hit the drop down and then we're going to hit play so if we go into the game and go to the workspace and go to our character which is our brde character or whatever character your name is inside of the game we're going to open this up and we're going to see that there is an object here called humanoid and this humanoid is basically used to tell us that this is a player that's stepping on this part rather than just another random part stepping on this so we're going to be detecting this using fine first child so what we're going to do is hit stop and we're going to go back to our script that we created so we're going to locate the humanoid of this part so we're going to say local other part equals oh and there's one more thing I forgot to mention too is that so if we're we're inside of the game and we're stepping on this part let's say most likely we're using our right foot or our left foot to be stepping on this part and as you can see with the part that's touching this kill brick part we can locate the humanoid that is basically contained within our brawl battle um character so the way we can do this is we can actually go to our script if we hit stop and we go to our script like this we can find the humanoid using the other part uh by saying local humanoid equals other part. parent colon find First Child open close parenthesis and we're going to say humanoid just like this so basically when we have our other part which is going to be like our right foot or left foot we're going to get the parent of that which is going to be our character data model and then from there we're going to find um a humanoid inside of that player data model so then once we make this check we're going to say if humanoid then we're going to set the health of the humanoid equal to zero to essentially kill the player so this is a property of humanoid which we're basically just going to say humanoid do Health equals z so health is a property of humanoid for the character and if we set it equal to zero then that's going to kill the player so now if we go into the game and hit play so our character should be inside of the game and if we touch this part then it's going to kill our player like so so that is basically how we make a kill brick and we can also make sure that a character is touching this kill brick and not any other random part inside of the game so that is basically how we use fine first child and wait for child inside of our game and I encourage you to experiment with fine for child and wait for child for any other parts or any other functionality that you may think of for this challenge so for today's learning objective I want you to continue experimenting with that and once you do do that I want you to go down to the comment section and paste in your code for other people to to see that you are comfortable sharing and that is basically going to be it for this episode I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next one take care	16560	t	This tutorial addresses the fundamental pain point of object referencing and hierarchy management in Roblox, which is a critical bridge

5lvsRkx6878	I Learned How to CODE in 7 Days | Roblox	Simjet	226164	11:00	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lvsRkx6878	roblox scripting tutorial	making a robo game has been a dream of mine since I was young and I've tried many times to do so every time I failed due to my lack of knowledge but not this time I challenged myself to learn scripting in one week and if this video is out it means I did it let's begin before we begin let's have a quick overview of the plan for this challenge everyday I will learn something new to do with scripting I must spend at least an hour and a half learning how to script every day with this new knowledge I will try and code something anything by the end of the challenge I would create some sort of game even if it's small if I failed to make this game I fail the challenge let's begin with zero knowledge of scripting I open the script editor and try to code something anything the hell am I even doing it seems I misjudged how hard this was going to be I went on you YouTube and found this YouTuber called the dev King who had an entire series on how to code without hesitation I started watching how do I do the dev King help in just the first day I had completed this beginner series and I was very tired despite my fatigue I was engulfed in the teaching methods and along with my trusty notes I had really began to pick up the basic principles of scripting with my new skills I hopped into studio and created this I'm the best I'm literally the best it was was a small victory but it felt amazing day two baby let's as day two began a problem arose although I had completed the beginner series I know very cool it wasn't enough to be able to call myself a scriptor the end goal of this challenge is to make a full game but I wasn't at that level yet I wanted more I needed more I needed to become a king at scripting or so I hoped I dived into the first video of the advance series and it was pretty simple but as I got to the second third fourth fifth the hell does this even mean he's he's yapping like crazy if I don't understand this how am I meant to even make a full game my warrior mindset had depleted as I felt the disappointment of failing I was on the verge of quitting but then I remembered what my good friend jansu told me listen Sim jet you got to remember every master was on to begin that could be you too yeah Broski is not the main character after Jam's words of wisdom I made day's code and prepared for day three to make up for the episodes I didn't understand I used a well-known tool called the Roblox documentation if you don't know what the Roblox documentation is it's a collection of resources that help you learn how to create Roblox experiences it contains tutorials samples and API references for Rox studio and is a great way to learn program programming and designing on Roblox I continued watching and use a Roblox documentation to fill any gaps in my knowledge look they even have an AI that will answer all my scripting problems I was back on track and I was really starting to feel like a real coder so I asked my friend cyber for a small task Oh my days oh my it's jump scoot that cyber I forgot to tell you something now's not the best time to tell you but the reason I the reason I called you here was to ask for an idea or something to code no not now bro well why not we're doing this bro let's just get these books let's just get these books Jam's got two Jam literally has two oh my he's right there I'm going up with him no way Jem oh my cyber run cyber run Oh my days what what Jem oh shoot cyber cyber why did I decide to tell you indoors where's the books where's the book yes another book I see a book right there oh my God there's gem no no how did you die how did you die you died first exactly there to be like a portal system they have to get around the map portal system so cyber came up with a good idea of making a portal so let's get started first I inserted two parts into the workspace and added a script into the part that I want the teleporter to be in I then defined that two parts using variables and created a function that occurs whenever the part was touched and then made sure the part that touched it was a humanoid root part and if it was it changed the SEF frame of the human root part to the SEF frame of the location so if we touch this part we should get teleported yep nice it works let show cyber a creation bro that is trash where is the special effect and the sucking in animations and stuff like come on man I expect it better from you man you suck huh despite what cyber said my warrior mindset was back with the help of the robo documentation and the the dev King's methods of teaching I was on the verge of becoming Unstoppable I had covered tween remote events SE frames and I had finally reach a GUI series gu are the core components of making a game I mean it's literally always on your screen so I knew learning GUI was going to be a big step on my journey guys I'm not even going to lie gu are so easy I mean look at this shock concept I made it even works on an iPhone 7 a few hours later i' completed the dev King scripting tutorials and I understood the basic syntax needed for coding although I had learned how to script I had no idea where to start on making a game um what the sigma I'm joking I'm going to do it all myself my plan is to make an Obby but a bit more advanced I'm not going to show the process I've making this game here because I made a whole video on it here's some of the scripts that I made whilst making this game and here's the final game I'd been grinding my butt off for 5 days straight so I took a break from The Challenge to refresh my mind for the final days in the meantime I updated my mini game posted a whole video on the update drank loads of tea and consumed a bunch of carrots after touching some grass my energy was restored for the final stretch of the journey I swear this happens every video brother SE affecting me nah this is just more motivation for me let's do this now that I had all the core knowledge needed to script it was time to make the ultimate game ah the fresh air of an empty base plate I decided it was time to make my first ever simulator I click simulator I started by making a leader status script that save when you leave and load when you join and I remembered to enable access to API services to allow it to work as you can see if we change the value of the clicks on the server leave and rejoin our value saved nice I then insert Ed a temporary button and made the clicking system of the game by using remote events if you don't know what a remote event is remote events is how you connect the server and C together the client is what the individual player sees such as the own cursor and server is what everyone sees such as the map the reason for using remote event is so that you can connect things client sided and and Implement something sded it's kind of confusing but hey at least I understand sorry about that my inner nerd came out I also made sure to add a debounce to my system to prevent you pesc or auto click as you can see the cling system is working yeah since day five mini game took 24 hours I only had an hour left of the day to work so my time for the day had ended on day seven I continued the game by adding two new lead stats rebirths and gems you can rebirth by using clicks to increase your click power and you can get gems by rebirthing also don't judge the crappy UI we'll change it in a bit now about the gems you're probably wondering what's the point of gems if you can't do anything with them now you can spend your gems on more rebuffs to get more gems to get more rebuffs to get more gems to I asked my Discord if they wanted the menu to open from a GUI or an actual in-game shop and the in-game shop building won but I wanted the GUI option so we're going to do both and after 5 minutes of simple coding we now have a menu opener thingy I then coded the system where what no day seven was completed and I hadn't completed my game H who cares I've learned how to script now let's just finish this I then coded the system where you can buy more rebu for gems and it turned out pretty well here's what we've got so far so far so good I then asked being IM creator for some UI Vector icons because yes and it gave me these I transformed them into these masterpieces and put them into my game along with some frames for the menus as you can see we've got this thingy right here which shows the counter for how many clicks you have I then made a sick popup appear whenever you actually click by the way guys I am using the help of Dev blocks for this game but I'm not entirely just yoinking as code cut me some slack man I just Le a couple of days ago next I made this portal with a padlock disappears whenever you have enough clicks to afford it although the portals are working the actual worlds will be coming the next video on this this game so stay tuned for that I then added a bunch more upgrades that you can buy such as click multipliers walk speed you get the gist and then J Scot challenge me to make a map of the game in 3 hours so let's have a Time La shall we and then Place some benches around the map Place some pads in case we use these spots in the future and also made a how to play GUI to guide new players on how to play obviously finally I made a module script that abbreviates numbers to a shorter form for example instead of this long number we can have this nice and short and beautiful and with that our final game is complete it definitely didn't take days throughout this journey I've learned a lot including scripting GUI data Store and More you guys must remember not everything you saw in this video contributed to what I learned it obviously took hours of practice and grinding this is just the beginning of my journey there's still loads to be learned so I'm going to keep grinding anyways I want to thank the dev King for his amazing tutorials Jam scoot for his wise words of wisdom and cyber for his motivation anyways like And subscribe join the Discord and I'll see you guys later see you all right Sim you w my respect	10036	t	This content addresses the high-intent 'how to learn Roblox scripting' journey, offering a relatable roadmap, resource citations like Roblox

p005iduooyw	The ULTIMATE Beginner Guide to Roblox Studio.. (Start BUILDING Now!)	SmartyRBX	4068697	39:33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p005iduooyw	roblox scripting tutorial	so Timmy wants to be a Roblox developer and instead of opening Roblox Studio he searches how to become a Roblox Dev and he just searches for hours just to find an easy way to become a Roblox developer he tries and tries and tries but it's just not enough for him why can't I get this he says any rage quits he just decides to give up on his dream of becoming a Roblox Dev and going back to playing pet simulator wait Timmy what are you doing the light at the end of the tunnel arrives Lord regulus the pro developer who climbed to the top of the front page in blazing speed with 15 games that hit the front page and hundreds of millions of visits and Robux made he can teach Timmy right Jimmy just open up studio and start messing around you'll start to get it with enough work okay so Underlord regulus's guidance Timmy goes ahead and tries it he opens up studio and starts messing around placing parts and trying to make the games of his Wireless streams and with enough time and dedication he begins to move Parts at the speed of light he makes the game of his dreams and starts to see it all come to you hold up hold up hold up this is not gonna happen that easy but at least it's somewhat relatable this guide right here is going to show you exactly how to use Roblox Studio from start to finish exactly down to the Last Detail this is the best guide you're going to see on it I started just like you with zero experience and now you are lucky to get this very video I wish I had when I got started it would have been way easier and I would have learned way faster saving me days or weeks maybe even months of time so let's get started first we need to download Roblox Studio of course now this is pretty easy obviously if you've downloaded Roblox on your computer you should already have studio and all we need to do is search for it so if you're on Mac you can click the search button on the top right of your menu bar at the top of your screen or if you're on Windows like me go ahead and click the search button down here and you can go ahead and click and you can type in Roblox Studio it should show up and if doesn't you can go ahead to roblox.com create and there will be a download link there I'll also link it in the description for you to go ahead and head over there one of the first links in the description cool now let's let Roblox Studio load up and let's get into it so we want to make our first game Roblox Studio has a few different sections where you can make a game and edit all the games you've made in the past and these sections of Roblox Studio are on the left hand side you can go ahead and see there is a new project button there's a my games button there's a recent button and there's an archive button now the most important one when we get started is new because this has all of our templates where we can choose different templates to get us started with and really you only need to worry about these first three the other ones are not that great to be honest and you can go ahead and see your games here and all your group games and then recent we'll show you recent projects you've opened on the computer that you're using so let's just start with a base plate a basic new base plate right here not classic base plate let's just use the normal one and there we go you've made your first Roblox game congrats you can close this video now wait wait no never mind uh keep watching and your first quote-unquote game but there's a lot more to understand to get started in Roblox studio so let's go the UI of Roblox studio so the first thing we're going to look at is the UI or user interface of Roblox Studio which includes all of the buttons panels and menus in Roblox studio now I'm not trying to overwhelm you with a bunch of stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and show you the main panels and we'll get into everything else later first is the top bar of Roblox Studio this is where we're gonna get started so first one in the in the top left is file and this has what you'd expect from your average program so as you can see we can see our recent games we've edited you can see new you can see open from file open from Roblox close Place Etc now you can save to a file which will save as a Roblox Place file which will allow you to access your place on the computer or send that place to somebody else as a file so they can edit that instance of the place but don't worry about that the main one you need to worry about is publish to Roblox publish to Roblox allows you to put it on the website public so that it can be played by everyone of course if you set it to public and save to Roblox saves it but it does not make the changes public so I can go ahead and publish and that's going to be seen by everyone below this menu bar below this top menu bar up here we have a selection of items which are very important to the use of Roblox studio and especially to building so to go ahead and move around in Roblox Studio we can right click to go ahead and look around in Roblox Studio we can look around in what we call the viewport which is in the middle of the screen lets us see everything inside the game and we can use the a wsd Keys just like a game to go ahead and move back and forth but there's an additional two keys which you can use to move around which is the Q and the E Keys Q will move down and E will move up now you can right click look around but there's one last thing you can scroll to go ahead and go really fast and move around faster Zoom if you will so yeah the first button that we should take a look at is the part button part button will go ahead and place a part in our game if we click it and as you can see it has a drop down here which allows us to see block sphere wedge Corner wedge cylinder so we can choose different shape parts to use in our game now of course the main one you're going to be using is a normal block so now that we've placed this we can actually drag this around and we can choose where we want to place it now you might notice that mine is moving really smoothly and one really important thing is the increment so you can actually change the increment that this moves at and this brings us to these different tabs here which include home model Avatar test View and plugins view has all of the different things in Roblox studio and we can show them and hide them Tess has the play button start button and several other options for you to test Avatar has Avatar options for animating and designing avatars and model has most of the features that we need for building it has a little bit more than home but home has all the main ones but if we go to model it actually has this thing called Snap to grid now snap to grid is actually going to allow us to go ahead and change the increment that we move and scale Parts at so if we change this to be checked off I'm not sure most the time most the time yours should already be checked and it should say one stud by default and 45 degrees as your rotate now this is horrible by the way 45 degrees is bad for rotation as you can see it rotates really really really stiffly we don't want this and so I usually have mine at 15 and then I leave my move at either 0.1 0.25 or 0.5 and then sometimes I turn it off when I'm moving around bushes and stuff but a really good one to start with is probably 0.5 or even one stud because one stud is good and one method you could do is you can start building with one stud and then later you can go ahead and switch to smaller ones as you get more into the deep details of your build now you'll notice that on both the Home tab and the model tab there is a select move scale and rotate tool and these are very self-explanatory select is very useful when you just want to drag stuff and you know move things around without worrying about moving it with any other type of dragger and having these in the way you can just drag it select it deselect it now move is for more exact movements so you can of course always move your part by just dragging it but you're going to notice pretty quickly that building things well using that dragging feature is going to be horrible so I highly recommend that you go ahead and use the move tools for more exact movements so we can go ahead and drag and we can move it up and down left to right and that type of thing and by the way this moves on the y axis this moves on the x axis and this moves on the Z axis and these represent different positions inside of the game world now we'll get into that more later but it's good to know X Y and Z especially if you're going to go into scripting later and especially if you want to be an advanced Builder now back to the UI around the rest of the screen we have several different panels and by default you have the toolbox or you should have the toolbox the properties window which is right here and usually I believe that it is right here actually and we also have the output window and this will spit out different things from your code but we don't really have to worry about this right now so let's close that now if you do not see any one of these menus you can go ahead up here to view and we can select Explorer and you'll will see it disappears and appears and there is a chance that it might be stacking up with other windows and glitching out in that case you can click it a ton of times until you see it on your screen or you can close out windows until you see it so I can go ahead and close out tool grip editor and all this stuff and then I'll be able to cycle through these easier so let's go ahead and look at each individual one of these main panels so toolbox you can get your models that you've made in the past in the inventory section or in this one that lets you see the models you've made and this one shows you recent models you've used this one it's your models these are very similar tags except this one allows you to see group models too now this one is the interesting one you've heard about free models right and if you're really new to development you probably don't necessarily even know how to get them but you can go ahead and get free models from this you can get all kinds of different models that people have made now most of these are not the best quality and a lot of them if you use all three models as you've probably seen all free model games nothing matches up it's horrible to use all free models unless you're very careful with it which it does take some time and practice honing your own building skills to know how to match together different free models but with that in mind they're okay to look at and learn from but I would not recommend making entire games with them you can practice with it you can practice dragging stuff in practice handling models with these it's very good but we don't want you sitting around throwing free models in studio that's not going to do anybody any good and that's how I started but look that's not how we want to start if we're trying to learn this quickly and trying to skip all the randomness so next up Explorer now the Explorer the Explorer window is very crucial so pay attention it is very much so one of the most important windows in Roblox studio so you need to see this so each one of these inside of the Explorer window is called a service a service is a different piece of the Roblox engine that does a different function and it allows us to go ahead and do different things inside our game and contain different aspects of our game so the most important one and the main one that we'll be using is called workspace everything that exists visibly in your game that is an object not the lighting we'll get into that later but that's also visible everything that is in workspace is all that you can see in the game aside from light don't worry about that yet but everything you can see in the game is in workspace so this right here this is in workspace as you can see if we select it we'll see it right here this is a spawn location now face split this is our base plate it's in workspace if we hit the delete key it's gone and it's also gone from the Explorer so I'm going to go ahead and click control Z or command Z on Mac to undo that and by the way to redo it is control shift Z or command shift Z on Mac now lighting is the other one you can see and you can change different aspects of how the game's lighting looks so for example we can raise our brightness do a bunch of cool stuff there's a bunch of different properties in lighting which allow you to change how the game looks and can go ahead and see how to use all of these in the video in the right hand corner you can go ahead and pop that open in a new tab and watch that after this so you can learn lighting if you would like because it is a very interesting and fun thing to do so you can actually make quite a bit of Robux easily by making lighting because in my opinion lighting if you have an eye for it is really easy to go ahead and start making Robux from because it's like one of the easiest things to make in Roblox studio so just a note there for any of you who want to learn a skill that can make you Robux fast lighting do it next up the basics of building so in this section of the video we are going to look at the basics of building and I'm going to show you how to build now that we're out of the way of the boring UI we're into building so if we go ahead and choose select by clicking on it if it's not already chosen so if it's dark gray like mine that means that it's selected if it's not dark gray then it's not selected then we can hover our cursor over a part and drag it wherever we want so for anyone over this but yeah but now let's look at the scale tool so the scale tool very similar in how it works to the move tool except you grab one of these draggers and you can go ahead and move it and see it stretch into the sky alright so now we're going to turn this part into a wall we're gonna build a wall so you can scale your part up and you can say you know I want to make this a huge wall and I want to stretch it over the whole base plate alright so we've built our wall so now what we need to do we need to look at the different ways you can scale parts so we've scaled this wall outright I've scaled out really long on both sides but there are a few different ways that you can scale Parts which are going to be really useful in building one way is by holding control and dragging one of these and you can go ahead and stretch it out on both sides and you can hold shift to stretch it out on all sides in One Direction if we hit Ctrl Z we can go ahead and undo that and if you go ahead and click control shift click you can go ahead and stretch it out evenly from the middle or the origin Point here and you can stretch it out in all directions that way now more keybinds you can go ahead and click control R and you can go ahead and turn it 90 degrees now you can click Ctrl T and this will turn it vertically 90 degrees interesting right control T though is a little bit is a little bit weird though alright now let's go ahead and delete this now we're going to look at some more keybinds of building and let's start actually building a basic building so I'm going to go ahead and add a new part in the model tab I'm going to click the part button and now we're going to hold Ctrl scale that down then I'm going to stretch this out let's make it a good length go ahead and make this taller we'll go ahead and click control D to duplicate this part we're going to stretch it all the way down here stretch it out to the length of wall we want move this move this out one stud and you don't want anything overlapping while you while you're building this is really important because if you have stuff over lapping let me show you so let's go ahead and select the part go to our properties panel and change the brick color to teal now if I stretch this over this you'll see that it starts flickering this is called Z fighting and Z fighting is a horrible looking glitch so you know this is normal and it's gonna happen on accident but we want to avoid this as much as possible so that's partly why I'm doing that to make sure we don't have any Z fighting I know that we aren't recoloring this we're going to leave it as medium Stone gray but it's good to keep in mind also while we're on colors there is a custom color property which I recommend using as much as possible because these are not really enough especially as you get more advanced in your builds now let's go ahead and click on this and hold shift and we can go ahead and have both of these selected at once then I'm going to click Ctrl D to duplicate then I'm going to click control r twice and now we have this on both sides now let's go ahead and add a roof but with the roof let's use a different kind of bar so let's click this let's add a wedge and then we're going to click Ctrl R drag this up here and then we're going to go ahead and stretch this out now one thing I want to do is I want to select this wall and check the size so it's 36 if your wall is uneven sized you might want to change it to something that's even but 36 divided by 2 is 18. so if we go ahead and make this 18 studs wide we can go ahead and make that good and then if we click control D Ctrl R twice we can go ahead and drag this back here and there we go so now we have our basic shape of a house or a building so if we go ahead and flick this and hold shift and click on this let's go ahead and recolor this let's make it let's make this white so I'm going to go ahead and choose a nice kind of quilt I think quill gray looks good and then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add a block all right then I'm going to drag this up here and stretch it out to the same size as the top of our roof maybe change this down to 0.25 see if that now we're having a little bit of an alignment issue here not exactly sure why this is happening let's see the size this might be fixed by changing the height of this if we had to add more of an even angle I believe it would be better but it doesn't really matter for now so I'm going to change the brick color to a nice Brown so we have our roof go ahead and click Ctrl D and then hit Ctrl r twice and then now we run into a predicament right so this is very important in building and I feel like a lot of people don't even know this but if you go ahead and see these draggers they're very they're lined up with the part right this is called local space and local space is the basically the position of the part the move tool is being based on the position of the part the rotation of the part it's using its own space to go ahead and calculate how it's going to move but obviously this isn't really going to work too well if we're trying to move it over there unless we did a this but it's gonna be hard to line up so what we can do is we can go ahead and right click and click use World space and we can change that to World space so now it's based off the whole world it's based off the world rather than the part so it's going to say the same direction as what we'd expect and now we can go ahead and move this in place with no problem and there we go another issue it's not lining up what okay this is weird now we could do the simple fix which is just to drag this but I do recommend the plug-in which is called resize a line I'll go ahead and Link it below for you it's really useful and it allows you to resize stuff and align edges so you can go ahead and go to your plugins tab after you download it and you can usually just get it in plugins actually on the toolbox so if you go to plugins search up resize align we can go ahead and get that stravent resize align and use that so geom tools we'll open that up if you have multiple by this guy I recommend all of these by the way but resize the line now we can go ahead and click on this click on that and align those two edges up and now it's good no problems there anymore now I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to select this actually let's not do that yet I'm going to select I'm going to box select click from this corner drag select all of these I'm going to make the walls a nice red but then I'm going to go in here change this to be a darker red and we'll call that good right there and now I kind of want to extend these walls out just give it some depth you know let's just do that on one side let's just do that on this side just a little bit there we go not the greatest not the greatest but very good for starters now let's go ahead and look at how we can make windows and doors and that kind of thing inside of your building so one way you can do this is by simply hitting Ctrl D on this part holding control and then now we have a center right we have a center part and we can say that's our Center and then we can just go ahead and resize this down and I'm gonna go back to 0.5 I'm going to use resize one real quick and yeah so okay go back down to 0.5 and now that we have a center we can go ahead and go off of this I'm gonna align these with resize the line and now one two three four five I'm gonna I'm gonna do one stud okay so that was two and a half studs all right drag that now I'm gonna hit Ctrl D to duplicate that and I'm gonna go ahead and move that over here and there we go so that is how you can get a centered up hole or window now we can just go ahead and duplicate this boom and grab resize the line resize those Ctrl D that scale it down and there you go you pretty much get the gist and go ahead and duplicate this we can go ahead and make some window sills and let's go ahead and go back down to 20.25 man so this is one issue with building studio and why I recommend learning blender because it can be really annoying to be doing all of these scaling and measurement Etc so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate that why is this not looking Center all right so I went ahead and added some stuff to my window now we can go ahead and duplicate a part in here hit Ctrl D we can go ahead and hold Ctrl scale that up let's uncheck the move make that thinner turn it to blue and then we can go in properties and we can go ahead and increase the transparency and also the reflectance to get a nice look for a window we can change the material to smooth plastic and we can go ahead and have a pretty nice looking window so pretty good not the greatest but we're going to improve with time as you build and get better at it now I could do a much better window than this but I'm not going to worry about it for now because we're just looking at the basics now another way is with what we call unions so unions in studio is another feature involved with building and this lets you cut Parts out of other parts and glue Parts together and all that kind of stuff personally I'm not the biggest fan of unions but for simple things I believe they're very useful sometimes and even necessary so you might run into problems and builds and you need to to You Know cover up a gap or fill something or do something really quick that is when I personally think unions are the best and otherwise you should probably use blender for it but unions can also be used for things like Windows so you can hit Ctrl D hold Ctrl hold Ctrl and we can go ahead and just scale this down uh we can right click and we can click negate to go ahead and turn this in to a negated part which will let us cut it out of another part but we can also hit control shift n or command shift n on Mac to go ahead and make this negated now you'll see it's like red transparent now if you hold shift and click on another part we can right click and hit Union or as you can see the keybind is Ctrl shift G so if you hit Ctrl shift G we go ahead and Union that together so now we have a union now one issue with unions is as you make more complex ones Roblox gets really bad at rendering these and they kind of are bad for your game's performance so you want to avoid using unions too much one other issue we won't be able to go through this usually because now we this is basically a mesh and a mesh is one object rather than a bunch of parts so it's it doesn't know exactly how to calculate this so that you can go through this hole but there is a fix to keep in mind so if we select this we can go ahead and go down in our properties and change the Collision Fidelity to precise convex deposition and we'll be able to go ahead and jump through this of course if the space allows example but yeah that gives you an idea of the basics of building now we're going to go ahead and look at some more stuff in studio such as how to publish and save our game we're going to go ahead and look at how to publish your game so if we go ahead and click publish to Roblox we can publish this game but I'm going to click publish to Roblox as just so that I can make a copy for an example for you guys so I'm gonna hit publish Roblox ads and we're gonna make a new game and now you'll see here that we can name it and we can name it whatever we want so we can name our game blah blah blah blah test I don't know and then we can do whatever we can create we can choose the Creator we can choose the group we want it to be in or you can have it created by yourself you can create the genre which helps Roblox catalog categorize your game a little bit and you can choose which devices it can be played on or recommend checking off console and team create team create lets you have people work with you in studio on your your project just like it was a game on Roblox like you're playing together except you're all in studio building at the same time which is a really great insanely useful feature that I use all the time with friends and development Partners so yeah really useful now once you're done setting this up you can hit create and it'll publish it on Roblox so some more about the studio UI now we can go ahead and look at file and we can see that we have several things and the first one I want to show you is Advanced now Advanced actually has something which is called customized shortcuts now you might have been wondering earlier how was I possibly opening up resize aligned so fast well I have a custom shortcut for resize a line so you can set shortcuts you can change the default ones to whatever you want so that you can go ahead and use stuff in studio way faster so let's go ahead and click customize shortcuts and we can go ahead and find resize align for example people and we can go ahead and click on the shortcut Box by double clicking it then we can click r or whatever you want I use R for mine and you'll go ahead and have a shortcut for resize a line or whatever you're setting a shortcut for so it's really useful and I really recommend doing this but be careful when you're doing this don't accidentally reset something like really useful you're going to mess some stuff up so I'm going to hit OK and then another thing is beta features so beta features allows you to see some of the new features in studio that they're adding and it allows you to get these new things in studio early so one thing I want you to make sure you have enabled is material generator now material generator is a new thing made by Roblox which lets you make AI materials really like they're really awesome so let's click make sure that's checked off and we'll go ahead and hit save now in the Home tab you should see it here I'm not seeing it for some reason so I'm going to go ahead and reopen my place alright now see it right here material generator and you might have to reopen Roblox Studio like I did to see it because it's a new feature but with this you can go ahead and generate materials for your game so rather than using the default ones like oh leafy grass mud all this stuff now instead of having to import your own or make some you can just have ai make it so go ahead and set this back to smooth plastic and now if we go ahead to the material generator we can go ahead and type in let's say what is it called exciting yeah it's called siding there we go then you can go ahead and hit enter or click generate and boom it's going to spit out some textures for us and these will be instantly able to be applied so wow actually these are really good so let's go ahead and try this one here and you can go ahead and scale it down change the studs per tile you can make it organic to make it kind of randomized looks pretty cool I'm gonna go ahead and see some other one this one I like this one it looks more cartoony but it always does have the PBR you can always take that off though hard choices huh I think I'm gonna choose this one I think this one's the best so and we'll go ahead and choose the base material I'm gonna make that wood planks and I'm going to click save and apply variant you can change the subs per tile to change the size and now we can go ahead and select all our parts and close this out and we can go ahead and go into we can hold shift to select those by the way we can go into material variant and change that to red house siding material and there we go so you might see we're gonna have some Z fighting so things aren't going to line up fully but that's an easy fix as we mentioned earlier although tedious it's pretty easy we can move these scale them to change how that looks you might need to do this you know pretty easy stuff I'm going to use resize line now that we have a key bind we can click R and go ahead and do that go ahead and scale that good enough for now now I'm gonna make a roof material just for fun Roofing horizontal black let's see what it spits out for us I kind of like that but I'm gonna ask for a more cartoony one so let's see what it does interesting huh interesting wow okay ah okay so I'm gonna use this one and let's try organic all right cool okay now there is another plug-in by the same person who made this it's called material flip and this will allow us to flip the materials you can get this in toolbox by searching it up and there we go so now it is the right way and I think I'm gonna extend the roof out one pretty nice with those materials so those are a lifesaver especially for new Builders really really insane so you're gonna be able to make some really unique stuff with that but if you right click this and you click insert object there are a ton of different objects you can mess with and I recommend trying out textures which allow you to make a tiling image of your own and decals which allow you to add an image so we can go ahead and insert a texture in here and do whatever we want with that but for now you've mastered most the basics of building in Roblox studio and you're ready to take your skills to the next level so now let's look at some more advanced building techniques so first up grouping and ungrouping so we've looked at unions and unions to let us combine Parts but this is a lot different this just lets you make different groups so if we go ahead and click up here and drag and box select our house and hit Ctrl G we can make a group now this is one combined group you'll see it's a model in workspace we can right click this and rename it of course and name it house one and by the way when you're naming I recommend not doing any spaces so it's easier for when a scripter goes ahead and works with it now we can go ahead and drag this around as one thing thing and this might happen that happens with models but that is fine if we go ahead and click this and change the primary part to Something in here it'll fix that issue for us so yeah grouping is pretty awesome we can also group as a folder a folder does not let you do this but it's much better for organization purposes so you can right click and click group as a folder or you click Ctrl alt G to go ahead and make it a folder next up the terrain editor the terrain editor is a very useful tool and it allows you to make some very awesome things in studio if we go to view we can go ahead and find the terrain editor and it should be up in here somewhere yeah right here so this is the terrain editor you can just click that so you see it on your screen and we can go ahead and click the edit button to go ahead and see our main terrain tools so terrain now we can go ahead and add terrain right we can add it adding terrain's all right but it's not the greatest tool aside from when you're just getting started my favorite way to get the Baseline layer of terrain is to go ahead and get a plug-in called part 2 terrain and what this does is it goes ahead and lets us make any part into terrain so I'm going to go ahead and choose grass and click on the base plate now again you can find this plugin by going to toolbox and going to plugins and searching for part two Terrain go ahead and get that plug-in now you might notice that this goes ahead and makes everything a little bit sunken in that's fine we can just drag it and do that or you can go ahead and move your base plate down before you change it into terrain but yeah now the tools so we did we did look at app now add as I said I don't really like the add tool I believe the grow tools better in most cases but you can go ahead and change the different properties of this like the size the pivot position lets us change like where it goes based on your mouse cursor the plane lock and you can change the material of course and you can go ahead and change what material each one of these is with material servers so you can see in material service we can go ahead and choose one of our material variants that we already made for cracked lava so we can scroll down to crack lava and okay wait wait we need we need a material variant for collect cracked lava so you let's let's make a replacement one so I'm going to add a part and we can go ahead and go to the material generator and let's make make something new to replace cracked lava because there's not many times when you need cracked lava so let's see what do we make let's add a nice Rocky texture and we'll see what this makes oh that's actually pretty fire all right I like that kind of it's a little bit weird though let's just run with this one and let's go ahead and let the base material be cracked lava make the pattern to organic oh yeah that's better save and apply that and boom now we have that material variant in here which you can go ahead and go back to material servers change cracklava's default variant to big rock material and we got ourselves that now it's red how do we fix that well you can go to terrain go to material colors and change that back to Gray and there we go so we're good now now let's go back to the tools I went on tangent there but we're gonna go ahead and subtract this so we can choose the subtract tool size that up and we can go ahead and start subtracting some of our terrain I'll just you know make sure we have plane lock on and just delete that so next up grow tools so you'll see we have this messy look here actually we're gonna fix it so I'm gonna change the base size to bigger and we're just going to scale all this terrain up we're gonna make some hills heels are nice make some nice area in here now let's make some really big hills and on the sides of these big Hills is where we're going to use our material that we made because on the sides of Hills we start getting this brown material and it doesn't look that good in my opinion so we can fix that now I'm going to go ahead and paint so the paint tool is very useful you can click the paint tool size that down then we'll go ahead and grab the cracked lava and ooh yeah I'm liking that a lot although I want this texture to be bigger so I'm going to turn off by the way I'm going to turn off plane lock because paint tool is horrible with playing plane look but I'm going to go back to our material service I'm going to click on our big rock material and I'm going to change the studs per tile to be a lot bigger and try out regular is regular look better I'm not really sure oh we can't type in a number for this 100 that looks weird this is an interesting texture to work with but I think we're just gonna run with it we can paint some more on here I'm going to change it to mud on here paint some mud you know mix it up mix it up choose some leafy grass now leafy grass solves this issue see this it's all poking through a little easy fix for leafy grass size That Base size up and it'll help fix that and then we can add like some pavement or something pretty cool stuff this is all great but what about scripting I know that a lot of you guys might want to be able to script on Roblox and maybe you don't even want to be a builder well it's good that you went ahead and learned this so congratulate yourself for that you did a great job today learning this if you followed along I do have a special thing for you this is called the scripting Secrets course and it's a full course for scripting and it includes everything that every other course does not include there's no better place to learn scripting on the entire internet it has everything from the basics of Lua down to the advanced game mechanics and also exactly how to make your game of success I've worked with the Roblox coach to bring you this new course I'm going to

jUuqBZwwkQw	Lua in 100 Seconds	Fireship	2693567	2:24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUuqBZwwkQw	roblox scripting tutorial	Lua a fast multi-paradigm scripting language famous for being so underrated imagine a language that's easier to learn than python while also being faster and more portable than python Lua was named after the moon when it was designed by a team of computer scientists in Brazil in 1993 it's lightweight and extremely fast because its virtual machine Maps very closely to see and when used with its Justin Time compiler it's widely considered the fastest scripting language in the world this makes it ideal for embedding into other applications like World of Warcraft or Roblox for example where users can write Lua to build their own games and features because the language is embedded into the base game it's easy to learn because it has only 21 reserved words and has only one data structuring mechanism called a table that can represent arrays dictionaries graphs trees and more it also supports collaborative multitasking with co- routines its standard library is very minimal but it does have a large ecosystem of packages with the Lu Rock package manager to get started install it then create a file ending in Lua declare a variable by providing a name and value by default variables are Global but make them local with the local keyword it's a dynamic language so no type annotations are required we can then use print to Output the value to the standard output there are no classes in Lua but anything you can imagine can be done with functions and tables a function is declared with the function keyword then closed with the nend keyword functions are first class objects which means they can be passed around to other functions to support functional programming patterns now to structured data you create tables with braces a table is actually an associate of array which means the index in the the array can be replaced with different values by default it uses integer values and the craziest thing about this language is that it starts the index at one instead of zero like most languages that gives us a conventional array but we can also easily create a dictionary by giving the keys a string value now we can use four to Loop over every key value pair in the table the language is single threaded but we can use co- routines to pause and resume a function create a co- routine then use yield to suspend its execution now somewhere else in the code use co-routine resume to continue execution until you get to the return statement now if you're a c programmer you'll be happy to know that Lua has a very simple C API it allows us to run Lua code inside a c program or vice versa run C code from a Lua program now to execute your code open up the

9MUgLaF22Yo	Roblox Studio Basics - Roblox Beginners Scripting Tutorial #1 (2025)	BrawlDev	2330972	11:26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MUgLaF22Yo	roblox scripting tutorial	young little new bird doesn't know anything about game development but wants to make his favorite games on the Roblox platform he reads up on the Roblox documentation to learn how to make a game until he hits a roadblock trying to figure out what the heck a script is and how a game comes together and as a result of that he quits on day one and probably doesn't have a computer anymore after destroying it out of frustration and now he can't pursue making the games he's always wanted to make oh Newbert becoming a Roblox game developer doesn't happen overnight you'll especially have to put in the time put in the effort and face the struggles headon when you don't understand a concept especially in the world of scripting and programming in the beginning it can be very difficult and demotivating to continuously learn how to become a better Roblox scriptor when you keep getting faced with error messages and unintended effects in your game it's a real struggle most beginners face when learning how to script on Roblox which is why I want to make this playlist to help you reach your goals of making the games that you want to create on Roblox my name is brev and I will be teaching you everything you need to know to become a great Roblox scriptor I've been scripting on Roblox for about 7 to8 years and during this time I've made countless projects that just weren't successful but one thing that kept me going throughout all these years was the desire to learn more and actually have an interest in the things I was learning even if I fa challenges when learning new things especially during times when I was demotivated and I hope you can adopt the secret strategy to go through this journey of becoming a Roblox game developer as of recording this video I have have two playlists ready for you to watch once you finish this beginner guide the advanced scripting tutorial guide and the GUI tutorial guide it's quite a scary journey to go through all these episodes considering how many there are now but like I mentioned becoming a Roblox game developer isn't easy and so I would like to make the journey easier for you by having everything you need to know in these playlists ranging from the very Basics to the advanced concepts and accelerate you to become a pro Roblox scriptor and game developer in 2024 and with that being said let's now go ahead and start making games on Roblox all right so what you see here is the homepage of the software called Roblox studio now this is the software we're going to be using to create our Roblox games so that we can upload them to the Roblox website and so players can actually play your game that's uploaded to Roblox I'll leave a link to this in the description if you want to download Roblox studio so that you can log in with your account and then you can be greeted with this same exact home screen just like you're seeing in this video now before we do anything I encourage you to basically follow exactly what I do step by step so that you can kind of get a feel for how to use Roblox studio and you're experiencing what I'm teaching you while you follow through with these videos because just watching me go through these tutorial videos isn't going to be enough to help you learn so that's why I encourage you to literally do exactly what I do as you watch these videos to follow along and learn from doing it yourself as well so now that we've gotten that out of the way once we are here inside of this home screen uh Roblox has a bunch of templates that we can choose from as a starter place to start making our Roblox games for the purpose of this tutorial guide we're going to use this Bas plate template right here I'm just going to click on this and then what's going to happen is Roblox is going to load in this template that we just selected and now we are thrown into this world that we can now mess around with to create our Roblox game and upload it onto the platform now there are a couple of things here that I want to introduce to you so that you get a feel for how Roblox Studio works because that's our goal for this first episode it's to familiarize ourselves with using Roblox studio and some of the things that they have to offer and the first thing I want to show you is being able to navigate around this 3D world that you see right here that represents our Roblox game so I want you to imagine you're playing Roblox on PC the controls You' probably use are W and for the keys and also the mouse as well so it kind of works the same way here as well so if we hold W that's going to move our camera forward if we hold s that's going to move our camera backwards if we hold a that's going to go left and then D that's going to go right and if we want to move the camera specifically then what we can do is hold the right Mouse button and then drag our Mouse around the world so that we can change our camera to face a certain direction and we can combine these movements together so that we're able to move around Studio as we so desire to uh some other things we can do is hold Q to make our uh camera go down and then hold e to make our camera go up and we can even use the scrolling wheel to scroll outward and also scroll inward as well so these are some basic movement controls that I will um introduce to you for this episode and maybe go through some more later down the line but that's like the basics of being able to move around inside of Roblox studio so now there are some some windows that I want to show you that are going to be very important for the entirety of this tutorial guide the first one is this Roblox Studio ribbon up here that basically shows all of the resources and services that they have provided to us so that we can use them for our Roblox game so right now we're in the home category so if we select a different tab like model then it's going to show us a bunch of different things here that we can use and if we go to Avatar uh it's going to show some different stuff test view plugins and all these other sorts of things that are going to be very helpful for us now another window that's extremely important to understand is What's called the Explorer as you can see right here on the right side you can see that there's all of these different folders inside of here with different names and I'm going to try and give a brief explanation as to what this all means well to basically summarize what the Explorer is it's basically a directory full of folders that have its own specific purposes where you combine all of them together to make up one Roblox game so every single Roblox game you can think of basically has this structure right here with all of these different folders with different purposes that you will need to learn how to use as a Roblox game developer so one of the ones uh as an example is called workspace uh workspace is what basically shows us the entire 3D World and this is how we're able to render things inside of this game screen it's when we put objects inside of this workspace folder now if we were to open up this workspace folder so if we click on this Arrow that's um to the left of it then we can see that there's actually stuff contained within this workspace folder so we have the camera terrain spawn location base plate and things like that and if we open these up we can see that there's other stuff in here contained within the thing that's within the workspace so you can kind of see that there's this hierarchy structure going on uh with this workspace and it's very important to understand the structure when you're working with finding stuff within your game and so it's a really good practice to understand how this structure works now if I were to select one of these objects like let's say the workspace uh we can see that down here uh it showed a bunch of things in this uh other window called properties now this is the next window that is going to be extremely important to understand so basically what this window does is it shows all of the the properties the attributes the settings or configurations whatever you want to describe it as uh for the objects that we selected so what we selected is this workspace object and there's all these properties here um that are associated with that object that we can actually change ourselves um and if we select a different objects like let's say the spawn location it's going to show different properties for this spawn location object and we can actually change it and see the change in real time inside of our game so if we were to let's say change um the color let's say so if I click on the color then it's going to show us this color wheel right here that we can just pick whichever color we want so if I were to let's say pick this color and I hit okay then it's going to change the color in real time and we can actually see this change inside of Roblox studio so that's kind of a cool thing to know about uh when it comes to understanding the properties window and also the Explorer window and how both of them work together to basically um have stuff inside of our workspace and now the next thing I want to demonstrate is being able to add parts inside of the game so I'm actually going to deselect the spawn location by simply selecting anywhere inside of this world uh just like that and what I'm going to do is go on the top ribbon and click on this part button that's inside of the insert category so I'm going to click this and as you can see Roblox has inserted a part for us to use and what I can do is take this part hold left click and drag it wherever I want to put it inside of the workspace now there are other tools that I want to introduce to you that you might find extremely helpful so we're able to select this and move it around and this is what's called the select tool as you can see up here um on the screen the next tool is called move so if we select this then we can see these arrows that are surrounding this part so if we hold this blue arrow and then move it this way then it's going to move the part in this specific Direction and we can do the same thing for the red arrow and we can do the same thing for the Green Arrow as well another thing we can do is change the size of this part by clicking on this scale tool so if we scale this part this way then it's going to move it in this direction and the last tool is the rotate tool so if we select this then we can see that this basically resembles a bunch of circles we select whichever Circle we want and then we move it in that direction specifically so I'm kind of just moving this part around a little bit and that is basically how you use the rotate part now once again I want to deselect this so I'm just going to click elsewhere like this and now we have a part that basically just does absolutely nothing but uh what I wanted to get out here was uh getting the feel and practice for moving around Roblox studio and also adding Parts into the game so that's basically the introduction to using Roblox studio now at the end of every single video for this playlist what I want to do is give you a learning objective or a challenge um to assess what you learned inside of each video now for this learning objective what I want you to do is basically just continue to experiment with Roblox Studio either e by moving around inside of the workspace or by adding more parts like this so I'm actually going to go up here and I'm going to insert another part and we can do whatever we want with it by I don't know changing the brick color changing the size if we select the scale tool just like this and you know things like that you can even navigate through more settings over here and that's another great way of familiarizing yourself with Roblox studio and once you are done with this learning objective I want you to go down to the comments of this video and describe what you did for for this learning objective so that other people who watch this tutorial can see what other people have been doing and I think it would just be a really great way to show what everybody else is doing for these challenges now before we end off this video there's one final thing I forgot to mention and that is the importance of saving your work so that you don't lose your progress so what we can do is go on the top left here in file and we're going to click save to file as and it's going to show up our file directory right here and you can just pick wherever you want to save this Roblox Studio place in so I'm just going to pick this place you can even rename it to whatever you want to I'm just going to say beginner scripting guide to 2024 just like that and I'm going to hit enter and there we go now our place is saved and I encourage you to save your game uh very frequently so that you don't lose progress as you go through this tutorial guide so that's pretty much going to be it for this episode and I will see you in the next episode take care	12952	t	This content directly addresses the high barrier to entry and emotional frustration beginners face when learning Luau scripting, providing a structured roadmap and hands-on
